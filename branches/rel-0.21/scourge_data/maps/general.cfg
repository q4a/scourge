		answer.0=_( "Life is easier now than few score $years ago." )
		answer.0.1=_( "Now look what the cat dragged in. Haven't seen an $adventurer in these parts since the $goblin wars." )
		answer.0.2=_( "What ails you friend? Why carry all this $gear and $weaponry? Don't you know the roads are safe these $days?" )
		answer.0.3=_( "What $news do you bing from the world, stranger?" )
		keyphrase.1="_UNKNOWN_"
		answer.1=_( "Alas I know not of that to which you refer..." )
		answer.1.1=_( "My time is too short to speak of that." )
		answer.1.2=_( "Mmm, I'm out of pipe-weed." )
		keyphrase.2=_( "years,days,old" )
		answer.2=_( "We have been living in relative safety for some time now. Sure the occasional lost or foolish $fiend may wander into town, but the even the village folk can subdue those quickly. It ain't like back in the old days, when monsters would brawl openly in the streets!||These days we no longer need $adventurers to keep them in line! I'm afraid, you won't find much $news of challenges awaiting the likes of you here." )
		keyphrase.3=_( "adventurer,adventurers" )
		answer.3=_( "Is that what ye are? Adventurers?!||Ah-hahahaha!||Excuse, me... my mirth is... but you are so old?!||Well, never you mind me, I know it's not proper to make fun of folks. Especially folks with $weapons...||Well, look here, I mean no disrespect but there just isn't a need for your kind these $days. Sure, in the olden days we'd run for you for help, every time a maddened bauul crossed into town, frothing and seething with rage; just bent upon his fill of man-flesh...||These days are lives are simpler. This is a peaceful community... the larger cares of the world are far away from us!" )
		keyphrase.4=_( "gear,weapons,weapon,weaponry,trade,train,heal" )
		answer.4=_( "There are still among us who can help you with that. Though we're mostly honest farmers, the crafts of the $old days are not forgotten.||You are welcome to wander around town and as long as you mind your manners, feel free to enter any dwelling and converse with the owner. Some among us are traders, some are teachers and occasionally the odd sage also throws his lot with us, here in this small village." )
		keyphrase.5=_( "goblin" )
		answer.5=_( "The goblin wars were a dark time some $years ago. $Monsters, madness and disease ruled the streets... In those days, wandering $adventurers were treated like royalty! In return for clearing a village of the foul beasts, they were given any service of $gear free of charge." )
		
		# general knowledge (some of it not true)
		keyphrase.6=_( "Uzudil,SCOURGE,scourge" )
		answer.6=_( "It's a dungeon janitorial services company in Horgh, I hear. They claim to rid a lair of pests in two days, or your money back!||If you ask me, sounds more like a bunch of hero-has-beens looking to rescue cats that won't come down from trees... Who has a lair, and who's seen $monsters these $days?" )
		keyphrase.7=_( "Karzuul,Karzul,demon" )
		answer.7=_( "Well, I've never heard of him. A demon you say? Bah! Just some old fairy tale to frighten children with.||The gods look after us and keep us from harm! Like I always say, if I've never seen it, it doesn't exist." )
		keyphrase.8=_( "dwarves,Grizzled,Pony" )
		answer.8=_( "Yes I have heard of this group. A band of dwarven terrorist-poets, plying their filth around the mountains of $Thuzgol. These $days, it's as bad as it gets: some third-rate dwarven bravoes scaring the good folks by loud recitals of awful poetry.||Still, you should do well to stay away from them!" )
		keyphrase.9=_( "Guardians,Guardian,Guards,Guard,Realm" )
		answer.9=_( "The Guardians of the Realm are no more. There is simply no need for their services anymore.||Last I heard they all retired, hung up their swords and shields and living happily sipping cocktails somewhere to south by the sea." )
		keyphrase.10=_( "Sabien,library,Gormoril" )
		answer.10=_( "Sabien... Sabien... the name does ring a bell...||There is an old, crazed wizard holed up in the ancient library of Gormoril. What he does in that stink-hole is a mystery to me.||Probably communing with the dark powers if you ask me. One should always be suspicious of folks that read too much. Nothing good ever came of that." )
		keyphrase.11=_( "Mycotharsius" )
		answer.11=_( "Myco-who? Never heard of him." )
		keyphrase.12=_( "Mothrazu,druid" )
		answer.12=_( "A wandering druid with that name did pass through here some time ago. She seemed harmless enough...||Probably a bit of a looney, cackling to herself with a mad glint in her eye. Folks tried to help the old woman, give her food and old clothing, but she would have none of it.||She came through here, muttering about $Amod and watching the trees...||...sorry old wretch." )		 
		keyphrase.13=_( "fiend,monster,monsters" )
		answer.13=_( "Seldom one comes into town these $days. The era of concentrated sieges on villages is gone, my friend..." )
		keyphrase.14=_( "secrets,news" )
		answer.14=_( "Well now,... don't tell anyone but Jenna is with child!" )
		answer.14.1=_( "I once saw brilliant flash of light. The heaven's opened and the leader of the $Guardians of the Realm came before me. In his hands he held a flaming brand. He pointed at me and in a deep voice he cried 'Put down thy pipe-weed!'.||Haven't touched that stuff ever since." )
		answer.14.2=_( "Don't say I told you, but $monsters roam in the deep places of the earth. There may be none of them left here on the surface, but my cousin discovered an old cave some miles from here and therein... ||I shudder to recount it!||Eyes glowing with hatred, teeth sharpened on human bones... In the dark the old evils still reside." )		
		keyphrase.15=_( "planar,gate,device" )
		answer.15=_( "Now why in the heavens would you want to do that. It just plain not proper to travel between the worlds!||Sigh. If I can't dissuade you from this plan of madness, at least take some wine along. They say the ill-effects of planar travel can be reversed by rubbing a bit of grog on one's temples.||Oh, and do ask $Melathor about planar travel, he knows most the stuff of legends." )
		keyphrase.16=_( "Abyss,Abyssal" )
		answer.16=_( "Aye, the home of demon-kind it is. A dimension of evil, seething hatred, revenge and fear. Heard about it mostly from our healers as a place best avoided.||You may see it soon enough, spending your eternal after-life there if you aren't careful. This is why I always say, care for strangers such as yourselves so by $Amod's grace I can ascend to the heavens after my time on earth is up." )						
		keyphrase.17=_( "Amod,Amod-Rheinur,nature,trees" )
		answer.17=_( "Our lord protector, the god of nature. A jolly fellow he is! He lets us wander his domain, ply our skills to harvest his fruits, takes care of us when we fall ill and keeps our village free from $monsters.||Praise be to his name!" )
		keyphrase.18=_( "Melathor,Allovium,elf,elves" )
		answer.18=_( "Why the homeland of the elves, Allovioum produced the most wise, all-knowning elven wizard of all times!||Melathor... I say his name with awe! Never, a more pure of heart, clean of soul man of the sacred arts walked $Amod's green earth.||I hear these days he resides somewhere in the city of Horgh, helping all who come before him and showing them how a virtuous life can be lived, free of vice and ill thought. That man is a saint!||Any questions you may have about lost arts, and days gone by, best go and ask this holy man for advice." )
		keyphrase.19=_( "apocalypse,doom,magic" )
		answer.19=_( "Bah! Fanciful fantasies of a restless mind they are. Here in the villages, we think of the harvest and the coming of winter more than that." )
		keyphrase.20=_( "Orhithales" )
		answer.20=_( "He is a sage who lives amond the mountain dwarves in $Thuzgol. They say, he helped them defeat the goblins in the $Goblin wars.||I've also heard he is a good resource for questions about the local history." )
		keyphrase.21=_( "Thuzgol" )
		answer.21=_( "Thuzgol is an underground fortress-town of the mountain dwarves. A fierce, battle-loving nation it is! And among them lives the sage $Orhithales." )
		keyphrase.22=_( "Tree of Emeril,Arcanex" )
		answer.22=_( "A talking tree?! What do you take me for?..." )
		keyphrase.23=_( "Cronostar" )
		answer.23=_( "I gave it back to Johann, I swear! I only borrowed it to patch my roof in the first place..." )
