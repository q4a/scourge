LEGEND OF ZELDA:</u></em></font></a></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Lucida Blackletter" size="5"><strong><i>*Warning - this
section details my perception of the entire &quot;Legend of Zelda&quot; storyline, and
reading this may spoil your enjoyment of the games (including &quot;The Ocarina of
Time&quot;)*</i></strong></font></p>
<font face="Lucida Blackletter" size="5">

<p>Long, long ago, in the times of creation. </p>

<p>The three deities of All, Din of Power, Nayru of Wisdom and Farore of Courage created a
world in the mists of nothingness and nurtured it.</p>

<p>Its name was Hyrule.</p>

<p>Din started with the land. Creating everything from the refreshing waters of Lake Hylia
in the south to the towering majesty of Death Mountain in the north.</p>

<p>Nayru then looked around the land that was and used her wisdom to bring order and
infuse the land with magic and science.</p>

<p>This done, Farore added the finishing touches. The life that inhabited the land and
obeyed the laws of nature. Farore made many forms of life from the tiny f&#156;rie to the
magical imp, but Farores crowning achievement was the six higher species that were
created. </p>

<p>The dark skinned <b>Gerudo</b> who became master thieves. A tribe of women that live in
the desert and have a male every hundred years to continue the line. They have the Sage of
Spirit.</p>

<p>The fishlike <b>Zora</b> who live in the north-east and protect their Lord Jabu-Jabu
that blesses the water drunk by every creature in Hyrule all the way to Lake Hylia. They
have the Sage of Water.</p>

<p>The rock eating <b>Gorons</b> who live in the heights of Death Mountain and protect the
land of Hyrule from the dragon Volvagia there trapped at the summit. They have the Sage of
Fire.</p>

<p>The childlike <b>Kokiri</b> of the southeast unaging guardians of the Lost Woods and
the sinister magic that lies within. They are protected directly by the Great Deku Tree
that holds at the threshold of Hyrule, defending Hyrule from assault from evil forces.
They have the Sage of Forest.</p>

<p>The proud <b>Sheikah </b>who were the first to ally with the Hylians in a pact that
lasted millennia. They were fighters for peace, and guarded the royal family with their
lives. They have the Sage of Shadow.</p>

<p>The true <b>Hylians</b>.<b> </b>The final and most important race of them all. It was
relied upon the Hylians to be the wisdom to the Sheikas power and courage. It was they
that ruled Hyrule, and it was they that made the attempts of peace all over Hyrule. They
had the Sage of Light as well as the seventh Sage of Unity.</p>

<p>Farore knew that there was no guarantee that the species would unite in harmony. So it
was decided that in order to keep the balance, there would be a representative from each
of the species that would look after the six different aspects of Hyrules creation. Light,
Forest, Water, Fire, Spirit, and Shadow. It was then decided that in order to use their
powers effectively instead of warring with each other, there would be a Seventh Sage. A
Sage of Unity. Through History her name was known throughout the land of Hyrule.</p>

<p>Her name was Zelda.</p>

<p>However, It could not be entrusted on one person, to have this great power. In times of
hostility, anything was possible, including her death. So a Hero was prophesied to appear
along with Zelda, a constant companion and protector through time. </p>

<p>His name was Link. </p>

<p>Before the Gods left, the Hylians learnt many things from them, including great skills
in Science and Magic. The Hylians were the wisest people in the land, and they were
respected by all.</p>

<p>When the Gods left, they took a piece of each of their essences and placed it in the
form of a great golden triangle. It was named the Triforce.</p>

<p>The Triforce was too powerful an object to leave in Hyrule, so the Gods created a
mirror universe to Hyrule. The complete opposite, it was a land of truth where if anyone
entered, they would transform into the shape that reflected their hearts as a safety
precaution so no-one evil could grab the Triforce. </p>

<p>It was called the Golden Land.</p>

<p>As the worlds were both fresh, they were beautiful and serene and everything was at
peace. The Gods explained to the Hylians that the Triforce was a balance of the powers in
Hyrule, and that it had the ability to grant anyone that touched it whatever they desired.
They also stressed that anyone whose heart wasn't balanced touched the Triforce, it would
split into three parts, and the part that reflected the person's heart would stay with
them. The other two would be given to the Sage of Unity, and to the Hero of time. Eternal
peace could only be reached if the Triforce was in one piece and held by a pure heart.</p>

<p>The Sage of Unity was the only one with a pure enough heart to touch the Triforce, but
the Hero of Time was also balanced enough to hold the Golden Power. Only when the Sage of
Unity held the Triforce would the world of Hyrule be in permanent peace and prosperity.</p>

<p>The Hylians understood their duty and watched as the Gods left the world of Hyrule and
went to the Heavens.</p>

<p>The Hylian race grew to be a mighty empire, forged of peace and hope. Everyone was
happy under their rule. Meanwhile, the Hylians looked out for the Sage of Unity, and
protected the Triforce in its hiding place. There were many palaces built that held
gateways to the Golden Land. Each had its own defence from the Magic of the Golden Land.
It allowed a person to enter the Golden Land and hold their shape. Seven were made, one
for each Sage, as they were the only ones that couldn't be evil. These items were called
the Moon Pearls. </p>

<p>Each Sage has his or her own temple in appropriate places and each was linked by a
magical pedestal. When certain holy tunes were played, it would warp whoever played that
tune to the temple they wished to be in by placing them on the pedestals. These were
linked with a place in the Golden Land, which they called the Temple of Sages. Over the
years, as knowledge faded with time, the Sages wrote the history, and the prophecies of
the Gods in a book, a book that was to become known as the true text to ancient Hylian
culture. </p>

<p>It was the Book of Mudora.</p>

<p>It was well known, by the Sages at least, that in the Gods words, an evil force will
get the Triforce, and bring chaos to Hyrule many times. Afraid of this fact, the Sages
created a sword, a sword that was enchanted enough to repulse even powers given by the
Triforce. This mighty blade was set in stone, and was only allowed to be held by one whose
heart was balanced and strong, the Hero of Time. </p>

<p>This was the Master Sword. And it was held in the Temple of Time, allowing only one who
had the three spiritual stones of forest, water and fire, or the three pendants of the
Triforce, Power, Courage, and Wisdom to lift it above his head and use it against evil.</p>

<p>Over time, with no luck finding the Sage of Unity, the Hylian Empire broke down. Over
time, the palaces were destroyed, and the ancient artefacts of great power lost. Over
time, all items were hidden away in deep dungeons, protected by monsters and evil beings.</p>

<p>Of the Moon pearls, only one did not disappear into the sands of time, and the Master
Sword rested for centuries in the Temple of Time.</p>

<p>All was at peace, the legends had been forgotten, except the legend of the Triforce. It
was only a matter of time until the book of Mudora was found and translated. Suddenly all
the proof of the Legends was true. Many people searched for the Triforce, trying to
prepare for the Sage to come. The knowledge had been lost, the book did not describe
everything as it would be understood in that age. However, when found, one line of the
Triforce legend burned the pages of the book, and started wars of great hate and rivalry.</p>

<p>It read: </font><font FACE="Lucida Handwriting" SIZE="4"><i>In</i> a land beyond sight</p>

<p>The sky shines gold, not blue</p>

<p>There the Triforce's might</p>

<p>Makes mortal dreams come true</font><font face="Lucida Blackletter" size="5"></p>

<p>This stirred the greed in every heart in Hyrule. The race was on to find the Triforce
and become all powerful through Hyrule. This started a great war, where it wasn't a race
against race, it was man against man. Each individual throughout the land searched
aggressively for the power of Gold, it was fortunate that no one knew where it was, or the
Gods plans may have been disrupted, and Hyrule placed in Chaos for all time.</p>

<p>It was in this time of hate and anger that the saviours of Hyrule were born. Zelda was
kept inside the castle in Hyrule and was taught of her great destiny by her aid. A Sheikah
by the name of Impa.</p>

<p>Link was not so lucky. His mother bore him into the middle of the fighting. Seeing the
sign of the Triforce on the back of his hand, she knew she had to save the child to allow
the future to ever be bright again, and took him to the Great Deku tree in the South. The
Great Deku tree agreed to protect him, and bring him up as a Kokiri, and tell him of his
true heritage when the time was right.</p>

<p>Over the years, Link grew as a Kokiri and became labelled as the kid without a fairy.
Something that was strange indeed with the Kokiri.</p>

<p>Eventually, the time came to realise his destiny. </p>

<p>As he was cursed by the tide of evil that he had sensed coming for some time, the Deku
Tree prepared to begin the first chapter in the Legend of Zelda!</p>

<p>Link and Zelda were having prophetic dreams. Zelda was being carried on a horse away
from a great black stallion with a Gerudo male rider. She saw Link and realised his place.
Link saw the drawbridge come down from the great castle, and saw Zelda appear, being taken
on a white horse, with a strange man appearing on a black stallion, chasing afterwards. </p>

<p>Link awoke to the sounds of a fairy saying something about going to the Great Deku
Tree. Link went and gained the Kokiri sword and a Deku shield before heading towards the
Tree. With a lot of Courage, Link delved into the Tree, and tried to save it from the
monsters that crawled through him. It was too late, but before the Great Tree died, Link
was told of his heritage and what he had to do. He had to find Zelda, and give her the
Emerald of the Forest. Taking the Great treasure, Link hurried towards Hyrule castle,
where he met Zelda and was told to return with the other spiritual stones. Noticing a man
paying homage to the King who was the exact man that was in his dream. Zelda concurred and
said how if they were quick, they could defeat him.</p>

<p>Link went on his quest, and returned successful, destroying the tendrils in Jabu-Jabu's
belly, and destroying King Dodongo, thus clearing the cave of Dodongos, and allowing the
Gorons to eat. </p>

<p>But it was too late. The dream came true. This time though, as Zelda left, she threw a
magical item, the ocarina of time, the only item left that would give Link access to the
Master sword. The man came. Link drew his sword defiantly, and he was knocked down by a
magical bolt from the man's hand.</p>

<p>When he retrieved the Ocarina, he headed straight to the Temple of Time, where he
opened the Gate to the Golden Land. This unfortunately allowed the Gerudo to get the
Triforce, which of course, split. The Gerudo kept the Power, Zelda received Wisdom, and
Link Courage.</p>

<p>As he was a child, and not ready to become the Hero of Time, Link was kept in the
Golden Land for seven years, where he met the Sage of Light, a Hylian by the name of
Rauru. He explained that the name of the Gerudo was Ganondorf Dragmire, an evil Gerudo
thief that practised the black arts. The whole of Hyrule was under his curse, and it was
up to Link to awaken the other Sages, as Ganon had killed all the present ones except he,
and return Zelda as the Sage of Unity. Only then could Ganon even be combated. With
Courage in his heart, Link stepped forward into the land of Hyrule.</p>

<p>After awakening the following:</p>

<p><b>Saria </b><i>Sage of Forest</i>, in the Temple of Forest; a place she often visited.
</p>

<p><b>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ruto </b><i>Sage of Water</i>, once she was rescued by Sheikah from being frozen under
Zoras fountain and went to the Temple of Water to try and return the fountain to normal. </p>

<p><b>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Darunia </b><i>Sage of Fire</i>, who had tried to combat Volvagia after Ganondorf had
awakened him. </p>

<p><b>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Impa</b> <i>Sage of Shadow</i>, who had gone to the Shadow Temple to finally destroy
the evil prescence that had been held under the well many years ago.</p>

<p><b>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nabooru</b><i> Sage of Spirit</i>, who had gone to the Spirit Temple to deal with the
two witches and free the Gerudo from Ganondorf's reign.</p>

<p>All this was done with the help of a Seikah named Sheik. Link then returned to the
Temple of Time, to find Sheik waiting for him. It was then that Sheik revealed herself as
Zelda. Ganondorf, though, had been watching the whole thing, and kidnapped Zelda, taking
her to his castle. Link followed, and destroyed each of the six seals that protected
Ganondorf. He then defeated Ganondorf, who became the evil and massive <b>GANON</b> a
beast that would return again and again. Link fought bravely and defeated Ganon, freeing
Zelda. Seventh Sage, and Keeper of the Triforce of Wisdom. Between the two of them, Zelda
and the Sages sealed Ganon in the now corrupted Golden Land, unfortunately, Ganon took
they Triforce of Power with him. From now on it was known as the Dark World, and it was
forbidden for anyone ever to go there. Everything was at peace. This time was then known
as the Imprisoning War. And over time, it was forgotten.</p>

<p>That Zelda and Link perished, but before they did, it was arranged that the Triforce's
be separated. Wisdom would be kept in the hands of the Royal family, and Courage would be
hidden. The only way to find it was to place six magic gems in six statues contained in
six temples around Hyrule. </p>

<p>Of course in time, they returned in new incarnations. This time, they were brought up
in a world of peace. Yet they were still kept separate. </p>

<p>Ganon was not finished and started to build up his power in the Golden Land. He wished
many things, and became ready for his next assault.</p>

<p>In Hyrule, plague and pestilence went around the World. The king demanded someone check
the Dark World, but it was sealed. In desperation, the King called for anyone that would
be able to cure the land. This call was heard by a wizard named Aganhim. He cured Hyrule
with Magic never seen by the likes of anyone on Hyrule in the History of the world.
Everyone thanked him as saviour, and the King ranked him as the official successor to the
Seven Sages. However in his tenure, people began to disappear and never be seen again.
There was also rumours of experiments in the towers at night. The King was killed, and
Agahnim assumed control.</p>

<p>It was at this time, Link received a telepathic message from Zelda, asking him to hurry
to her. Link awoke to find his uncle girded for battle. It seemed that as they were of
that line that they could both hear Zelda's plea. His uncle left telling him to stay in
the house, but Link followed. Taking directions given by Zelda, Link found a secret
passage under the castle, and found his uncle dying. Fatally wounded by the guards who
were under an evil spell cast by Aganhim. His uncle revealed his quest before he died, and
begged Link to succeed. This he did, saving Zelda from jail, and taking her to a secret
hideaway called Sanctuary. </p>

<p>There he was instructed to see a descendant of the Sages named Sahasrahla. From there
he was told to get the <i>Pendant of Courage</i> which he succeeded in retrieving. He was
then told to get the other pendants, and then to get the Master Sword now in the Lost
Woods before defeating Aganhim.</p>

<p>The Pendant of Power was in the desert protected by many evil beings, and the pendant
of Wisdom was held in the Tower of Hera on the peak of Death Mountain. The final pendant
was held by a giant Wyrm. After these great battles, it was time to retrieve the Master
Sword a second time.</p>

<p>As the Master Sword was in Links hands, along with the book of Mudora and the last
remaining Moon Pearl, something terrible happened. Zelda was taken from Sanctuary. Link
tried to get there, but he was too late. From here he ran to the Castle, where Aganhim was
preparing to open a portal to the Dark World. Link charged in, preparing to risk his life,
but Zelda was trapped in the Dark World in front of his eyes, and the Seal of the Sages
broken. Link defeated Aganhim, where he was then pulled to the Dark World. Here, Link
saved the souls of the descendants of the Sages in the many evil palaces hidden in the
vast lands of the Dark World, and prepared once again to do battle with Aganhim. </p>

<p>Link was victorious again. Only this time, Link had given the final blow. It was then
that the truth was revealed. Ganon had possessed Aganhim, and used his body to dispose of
the descendants of the Sages. Ganon turned into a bat, and went to his final resting
place, the holding place of the Triforce of power in the pyramid in the center of the Dark
World.</p>

<p>Link fought his way to Ganon, where after a fierce battle, a Silver Arrow, and a hit
from the Master Sword dealt the final blow. It looked like Ganon was defeated. The
Triforce was rescued, and taken back to Hyrule Castle, where the Royal family protected
it. </p>

<p>This wasn't the end. Ganon had taken this opportunity to get into the Light World of
Hyrule, where he prepared himself again for battle.</p>

<p>In the following centuries, peace erupted. Everyone was happy and two of the Triforce
were holding the peace. The Master Sword was returned to it's sleep forever. However Ganon
returned with an army of monsters and made his attack quick, stealing the Triforce of
Power back. In panic, Zelda cut up the Triforce of Wisdom into eight pieces, and scattered
them over Hyrule, waiting for Link to find them. Ganon saw this, and took Zelda with him
and sealing his dungeon so that only someone with the complete Triforce of Wisdom could
enter. </p>

<p>Link played his part, and connected the pieces of Triforce. Ganon was waiting for Link,
but Link again proved to powerful for the Lord of Darkness, who was finally destroyed,
turning to dust, and disappearing forever. Or so they thought...</p>

<p>Peace returned, and Link decided that it would be a good idea to prepare himself in
case someone else attempted to steal the Triforce. Everyone agreed, and Link sailed far
and wide, learning more than any other Hylian ever. But on the way home, there were rough
seas, and Link's boat was struck by lightning. Link blacked out as his body was swept
beneath the seas.</p>

<p>He awoke in the arms of a young girl by the name of Malon. It was explained that he was
on Koholint island, a land of peace and harmony. Legends said that the land was all a
dream made by a being called the <i>Wind Fish</i>. Link explored to try and find his
sword, hoping it had been dragged with him. As he reached the shore, an Owl came to him,
and said how he was the one prophesied to wake the <i>Wind Fish</i>. Never failing to take
up a quest, Link obeyed the owl, and got the eight instruments of the sirens in the eight
dungeons dotted around the island. Playing the tune he learnt specifically from the
denizens, he awoke the <i>Wind Fish</i>, this complete, Link said goodbye to Koholint
island, as it disappeared with the awakening of the <i>Wind Fish</i>. Link awoke on his
boat, or what was left of it, wondering if it had all been a dream. It was then Link saw
the <i>Wind Fish</i> fly through the air, and blot out the sun.</p>

<p>On returning to Hyrule, dark things had happened. Impa explained that while he was
gone, an evil wizard had ordered the Triforce of courage so he could raise Ganon. Of
course this was denied, but the wizard had used powerful magic, and even the combined
forces of both Triforce wasn't enough to wake Zelda or hold off his armies forever. They
needed the third, they needed Courage. Impa gave Link the six magic gems, and told him
where the palaces were, Link was also told that if one of Ganons minions feasted on the
blood of the Hero, Ganon would return. Link was also told it was nearly the time for the
Sages to unite and cast the final magic to free Hyrule of evil forever. Link hurried in
his quest, and returned with the Triforce, only to find the wizard waiting for him.
However, with the power of Courage, Link won, and Zelda awoke. And with her, Hyrules
future was forever saved from tyranny.</p>

going to get my Zelda fix now?&nbsp; By putting Link into Q2, that's how!&nbsp; I rapidly
built a Link mesh in Q2Modeller, and linked (no pun intended) him to a biped in Character

right, and created all of the skins.&nbsp;&nbsp;All the weps were built and animated in

shield...when he isn't using them as his weapon (ie. when he isn't using the Super
Shotgun), they are mounted on his back. I know that the arm thing has been done before -
