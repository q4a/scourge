Place in quake3 dir \baseq3\

Thanks for Tpe for telling me to release it.

Hum, there are some bugs with the tags, they kinda strech and sometimes the model looks fucked cause it gets bigger and smaller.
Also the animations are kinda crappy.
Also it comes up with cant find pcx.pcx shader, i dunno what that is.
