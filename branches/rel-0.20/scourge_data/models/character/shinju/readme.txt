Model description       : my lovedoll entry, modified to kick the dissenting butts in 			  	  of those that didn't vote for her!
Additional Thanks to    : EvilBastard for his input on the original lovedoll; Shine for 		 	  agreeing to make a skin on such short notice (even though i ended 			  up doing my own); Wrath for inspiring me to make another PPM (his 			  reviews, anyway) and helping getting my skin right!
Other Info              : Well this is definitely a rush job, just 'cuase i wanted something 			  to do this weekend (and boy was i busy, jees)!  Later on i might 			  do VWep, but i doubt it - i'll probably just convert her to Q3 			  format.

And now for Shine's part:

note from shine: the skin was fun to do. I would've included more but fOoL had to get his butt to the army for a couple months, otherwise I'd have included at least ten skins. :P  the thing was a total rush job, and my first attempt at flesh. the pallette didn't load too well, and it's not remarkably detailed, considering I had to get it done in under *TWO DAYS* for it to be included with the model. I wish I'd had more time to work on it, but oh well. I might also add that a MAJOR point of inspiration \ reference pictures was the lovely Korean goddess named Sung Hi Lee, who is, in my opinion, one of the most beautiful women I've ever seen. but, um, that's just my opinion, like I said. congrats to fOoL on such a great model, and for helping me with my lovedoll. my debt is repaid. :)  btw, I'll probably have done another skin or two, so check my site at http://www.planetquake.com/shattered/ ..  enjoy.  - Jon 'shine' Jones <shine@planetquake.com>
