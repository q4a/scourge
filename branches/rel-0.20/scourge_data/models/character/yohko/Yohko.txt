Model description       : 

	Yohko is an anime character. Yeah, I know swords dont shoot bullets... use your imagination.

Other info              : 
	She is a little hefty on the polys, it's all that damn hair. I spent 90% of the time working on this model trying to get her skirt out of her legs. You can still see it intersecting on certain frames, but i got most of it.

Please, Please, please someone send me a soundpak I couldn't find good Yohko sounds anywhere.
