Model description       : This is the Darkness model, arch-enemy and principal character of 
                          "The Darkness" comic book.  Also known under the name ok Jackie 
                          Estacado, young mafioso of 21 years old.  So, at this age he takes 
                          possession of the Darkness power and, in the same time, learn that 
                          if a women gets pregnant of him, he'll die ...Poor guy!

Other info              : Darkness is the first model that I make, but not the last!, so go 
                          easy on the critical :)  It's a bran new model, with a bran new, that
                          I made with the software TrueSpace4.  I had hard time doing the hair,
                          and the head has a lot of wasted polygons, next time I'll do better.  
                          For doing the animations I also used TrueSpace4.  There are some 
                          imperfections but I like the over all look.  I tried the best I could,
                          with my little animations experience, to give a "soft" look to the 
                          spikes that Darkness has on his back. I think that there's a little 
                          problem with the Bounding Box, I think that it's a bit too big.  For 
                          the skin I used the software CorelPhotoPaint8, and some pictures of 
                          the French edition of the comic book The Darkness 1 to 3, pictures 
                          that I scanned and pasted on the skin.  I think that the result is 
                          pretty cool, since I wanted to keep the original look of the character.
                          But I never saw any pictures of the back of Darkness, so I used a body
                          builder picture and tried to manage with it.  Same thing for the gun, 
                          I used a picture of a M16 with grenade launcher attached to it.  I 
                          mapped the skin with NST.  By the way NPherno you're really the best!
                          I confess that the skin isn't well mapped, the level of wasted skin is
                          pretty high. For much detail I piled the arm together, so as the hair 
                          etc.  I also cheated a bit by stretching some polygons less important 
                          in the only goal to win used space on the skin.  I used Q2modeler to 
                          solve the "NULL skin found" problem. I used Qdata to compile the model.
