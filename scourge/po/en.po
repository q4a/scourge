"||S.c.o.u.r.g.e. is a rogue-like rpg that lets you control a group of four "
"brave heroes.While working for a dungeon janitorial services company they "
"become unwilling participants in an effort to stop a mysterious force from "
"wiping out humanity. Boring you say? But wait, there is more! Your stay at "
"the S.c.o.u.r.g.e. head-quarters is generously detailed in 3d! You will "
"travel to strange and exotic underground locations! The randomly generated "
"maps ensure the game's infinite replayability. There is A:music, effects, a, "
"a... a plot! You will encounter, speak, trade with, and occasionally "
"dispatch a large number of npc-s and monsters. Blood-curdling combat will "
"unfold in either frantic real-time or thoughtful turn-based presentation.||"
