<span class=invertBlock>Mac OS X</span>
<div class=block>
1. Get <a href="http://fink.sf.net">FINK</a> and install the SDL libraries.<br>
2. make -f Makefile.OSX<br>

You should see some warnings, but it should compile. I also compiled with XCode, but I prefer not to use ide-s.<br>
<br>
Mac OS X Notes:<br>
-After compiling on the command line, I could only launch the app from the command line. (Not the Finder.) <b>Note: this is fixed in CVS</b> <br>
-SDL or OpenGL seems to reverse the mouse pointer's Y coord. when running in windowed mode. I added code to work around this but I suspect this code will have to be removed in the future.<br>

<span class=invertBlock>Linux</span>
<div class=block>
1. Make sure you have SDL, OpenGL and GLUT libraries installed.<br>
2. make<br>

I run Mandrake linux 9.2, so older versions of gcc may give you problems.<br>
<br>
Linux notes:<br>
-To check that you're running in hardware accelerated mode, type "glxinfo". Look for a line like "Direct rendering". If the value is "yes", you're ok.
-Different drivers have spotty support for different video modes. Currently S.C.O.U.R.G.E. runs in 800x600 32bpp mode. You may want to change the code if your card doesn't support this mode.

<span class=invertBlock>Windows</span>
<div class=block>
1. Install <a href="http://www.mingw.org/index.shtml">MinGW</a> and 
<a href="http://www.mingw.org/index.shtml">MSYS</a> (In that order!)<br>
2. Install <a href="http://mywebpage.netscape.com/PtrPck/glut.htm">GLUT for MinGW</a><br>
3. Install <a href="http://www.libsdl.org">SDL</a> for windows<br>
4. In MSYS, type: "make -f Makefile.win32"<br>
<br>
Windows notes:<br>
In general there should be no problems. You may encounter some opengl incompatibilities, but
these will be fixed in future builds.<br>
