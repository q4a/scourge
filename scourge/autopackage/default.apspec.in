[Description]
S.C.O.U.R.G.E. is a rogue-like game in the fine tradition of NetHack and Moria 
It sports a graphical front-end, similar to glHack or the Falcon's eye. 
I tried to design the 3D UI as a best of both worlds from old to new: 
It lets you rotate the view, zoom in/out, view special effects, etc. 
On the other hand I've always liked the old-school isometric games like 
Exult or Woodward.
