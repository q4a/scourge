# This file defines the climate zones including the vegetation layout
# and probability of certain weather in respect to the time of day and
# year. Weather probability is calculated as follows: The value after a
# time of year definition is taken as a base probability for that type
# of weather. It defaults to 0. It is then modified by a time of day
# probability which defaults to 1 if not given. If both rain and snow
# probabilities are defined, it will snow if the snow dice throw is
# higher than the rain throw.
#
# Valid time of year definitions:
#
# allyear (Jan-Dec), winterhalfyear (Sep-Feb), summerhalfyear (Mar-Aug)
# winter (Dec-Feb), spring (Mar-May), summer (Jun-Aug), autumn (Sep-Nov)
#
# Valid time of day definitions:
#
# daytime (6:00-17:59), nighttime (18:00-5:59)
# morning (6:00-9:59), noon (10:00-13:59), afternoon (14:00-17:59),
# evening (18:00-23:59), night (0:00-5:59)
