G:_INTRO_;Feel at home in the $ancient library of $Gormoril, traveler!
G:_INTRO_;Welcome to $Gormoril!

G:_UNKNOWN_;Uh, I don't know anything about that...
G:_UNKNOWN_;You should ask Sabien the Mage... perhaps he knows of what you speak...


G:ancient,Gormoril;This underground library was founded thousands of years ago by\
an order called the $Guardians of the Realm. Within it they tried to preserve all the\
knowledge of their age. Many of the $books you see around you are priceless volumes...\
Please try to be aware of this as you move around.
G:Guardians,Realm;They were an ancient peace-keeping force. Sadly all of them were\
destroyed in the final battle against the forces of darkness. $Sabien would know more\
about them.
G:library,books;Some of the books are magical and all of them rare. Throughout the ages, various\
thinkers, scholars and seers called the library of $Gormoril their home. Our current master\
$Sabien is a high level mage.
G:Sabien,Sabien's;We don't actually know much about him. Mostly he spends is time in $research on\
the fourth level. A word of caution, however: some of the library levels have been\
infested with monsters as of late. We know not where they came from and Sabien doesn't\
seem to mind them much. I'm sure that for heroes of your rank, they will be but a minor\
irritation.
G:research;Well, as you can imagine, there is much to learn, what with all these $books around.\
$Sabien's main area of interest appears to be closely tied to a $locked door on the fourth\
level.
G:locked;Ask $Sabien what is behind this door... We only suspect and are not $allowed to tell...
G:allowed;Remember traveler, this is an $ancient place... $Sabien's residence here is but\
a drop in the vast river of time... All of us are watched over by divine guardians, but for\
us in the $library their gaze comes from much closer...
