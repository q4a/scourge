P:Mycotharsius the Mad
V:_INTRO_;Stay your hand but for a $moment, intruders of my realm... I\
have $much to tell.
V:_UNKNOWN_;A blue bird sings in a shrill voice. Doom lies in its song...
V:_UNKNOWN_;Embrace the children of the night. They hold the key to eternity.
V:_UNKNOWN_;Is not chance a dagger blunt on one side and gravely sharp on\
the other?
V:moment,much;The pull of the depths are strong... Abyss-bound as I breathe\
my last, I must reveal to you the dark $secrets I was sworn to protect.\
I toiled long for $her... (cough) but listen, do you know this tune:\
fa-lala-laaa-le-grum-grum?
V:secrets;I was an important figure, you see? Fa-la-la-le-grum-grum! What a lovely\
tune it is! 'Tis a pity this noble throat shall sing no more. Not since $her arrival\
anyway. What little time I had to practice my art, instead I toiled for $her.\
"Go to the $Abyss Myco!" she would demand. That hag! I hate $her, I do! I will\
tell you all I know. Use my knowledge to stop $her plans!
V:Mothrazu,her;Who? Fa-ra-rum-grum-grum-lalalee. (cough) ...Oh Mothrazu you mean. She is\
nothing to me anymore... But beware! (cough) a powerful sorcerer she is, yes! Her\
hate of civilization (cities in fact) knows no boundaries. She will destroy this\
world and rebuild it according to her image: a vast sprawl of dark $trees. It was\
she, who asked me to travel to the very depths of the $Abyss.
V:Abyss;A dark, evil place that is... home to the most vile, outer ones. Their names\
cannot be whispered, their breath is death and to gaze on them is madness! Fa-ra-rum!\
I don't know why $Mothrazu wanted me to $travel there. Maybe just to torture me for my\
failures? La-la-lee, La-la-loo! I've been there before you know... the fiend $Karzuul\
was my downfall once. Haha! But I escaped; seek the red $teleporters!
V:Karzuul;Disease, he sickens the very thoughts! I served that dark lord before\
Mothrazu and now I will serve him again... (sighs) my fate is bound to the $Abyss.\
Fa-ra-ra-lee... I wish I knew the words to this song.
V:Sabien,kidnap,travel;Well I can't travel to the $Abyss on my own. Many of the\
red $teleporters are now locked... and always, always bring the $objects!| Anyway \
I paid the $Order of the Grizzled Pony to kidnap Sabien. The wizard knows the way...\
A bumbling magician he might be, yet, his skill is gifted beyond the others'.
V:objects;Rum-rum-lala-lee!
V:Order,Grizzled,Pony;The dwarves are the worst poets I've every met. Believe me, I\
would rather end my life here than to have to listen to their verse. However, they're\
much better at roguish tasks, such as $kidnap. They did manage to snatch Sabien, and\
yet he $somehow, escaped.
V:somehow;So it was you who helped $Sabien escape from the $Order of the Grizzled Pony!\
I should have known. The dwarves accepting a bribe was not a part of my plans. Fa-ra-lee-la-lum!\
It doesn't matter now... I just hope you're clever enough to stop $her as well.
V:trees;Yes that is $her plan: $Mothrazu intends to destroy the cities and cover the\
world in a forest. As a creature of nature, she claims it is her duty to do so.\
La-la-lee-rum-grum-grum! What a lovely tune. If you want to find $her, look in the\
deepest forests. She is the branch that holds the leaves, the trunk that supports the\
boughs... She is life and she is its destruction.
