G:_INTRO_;Be welcome in our humble $monastery wanderer.
G:_UNKNOWN_;I'm afraid I can't help you with that.
G:_UNKNOWN_;May you find that which you seek.

G:monks,monastery;Within these bare walls, we offer our devotion to the gods. We also\
act as a $safe haven for those abroad. You too may $rest within our halls for as\
long as you like.
G:safe,rest;Currently we have no guests staying with us. Ever since the\
$haunting began in our $cellars, we've had no visitors.
G:haunting;A couple of months ago, one of our order did not return from the\
$cellars when he went looking for candles. None of us dare venture $down there\
ever since.
G:cellars,down;We hear strange noises coming from below... they sound like frogs\
croaking. If you wish to investigate, please use the stairs next to the main worship\
hall.
G:Mycotharsius;Hmm... no, I can't say I've ever heard that name before. We're just\
peaceful $monks here.
