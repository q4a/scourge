G:_INTRO_;May you live as long as you're $worth stranger.
G:_INTRO_;Feel at home and $toil in our temple, traveler.
G:_UNKNOWN_;Perhaps you should ask her divine paradox, $Hornaxx herself...
G:_UNKNOWN_;Yes, I follow, may I ask you for a $year in return?

G:worth;This temple stands by the divine presense of $Hornaxx the goddess of arguments\
and contradictions herself. Are you worthy of her time? There is only $one way to find out.

P:Sorma the Arms Dealer
V:_INTRO_;Can I help you choose a $weapon, worthy of your skills, traveler?
V:_UNKNOWN_;I am terribly sorry, but my meager knownledge keeps me from following your thoughts.
V:weapon;I am a $traveling arms dealer. My $companions and I make our living selling\
our wares to customers of shall I say... distinctive taste... in this region.
V:traveling;$We have traveled south from Arthel through Orn. The road is a lonely and\
scary place these days. It just seems like some kind of $event is about to happen.\
And when it does, I for one will want to be below ground, with many feet of rock between\
me and the outside world.
V:companions,We;Oh, I travel with Lena and Romm. They're rooming in the other guest-cell. Lena\
is a wizard and Romm sells magic items.
V:event;Not sure what to make of it. Definitely ask the $godess if you talk to her.
V:godess;Surely you know what place this is! It's the temple that houses manifestations of\
her divine majesty, Hornaxx, goddess of arguments. Though not a $major god, her power is\
nevertheless great. You should do well to look her up if you need any questions answered.
V:major;She is a minor deity. As such, she has a lord and maker... I couldn't figure out who\
but then, I'm just a simple merchant.

P:Positive Energy of Hornaxx
V:_INTRO_;You have $sought me out for a glorious reason! Come closer mortal child...
V:_INTRO_;Have you come to $argue mortal? I do like a good argument!
V:_INTRO_;How do you define $good, mortal? Is it the opposite of $vile? If there were no\
evil, would there still be good?
V:_UNKNOWN_;What you say is of no importance to me.
V:sought;All seekers of $truth are welcome in my presence. As long as you show proper\
respect to me and my $maker you are welcome in my temple.
V:truth;Truth is never singular. All viewpoints are always represented. Therefore truth\
is seldom subjective, rather it is shaped by the minds and intentions of its perceivers.\
You should ask the twin energy of my divine paradox about the nature of truth as well.
V:maker;I am but a speck of dust from his divinity!
V:revelations;You will know mortal when the time is right. Meanwhile, ask my twin what you\
should do to prepare for it.
V:argue;Ah, you know how to please me... I do like to test just how far your mortal minds\
can reach. Suppose for example I were to ask you to tell me what it means to be $good? Is\
it being kind? Does this kindness have limits?
V:good,vile;My mind often wonders of this paradox. For I see your kind call themselves good\
yet perform vile deeds when others can't watch. By this evidence, I ask you: if there were no\
evil, would $everyone be called good, or $none be named as such.
V:everyone;Ah but you see, $good is what sets us apart from others who aren't. So it's not\
as simple as you propose. In order for you to be good, I would have to be evil. So now mortal,\
tell me: am I $evil?
V:none;A pessimist, eh? Perhaps you should find talking to my twin across the hall more fruitful.\
I can't stand your attitude of blank dismissal of the complexities of the world. Begone from my\
sight!
V:evil;Interesting... I'll say to you mortal, it is a fact not known to me. Gods don't concern\
themselves with such definitions of easy classification. Our work is not limited by death.\
Yet... we are bound to the soul and living spark in each of you. Without your belief we\
could not exist. Perhaps this is a subject I should bring up when speaking with my $maker. 
V:Unamoin;Ah you please me, wanderer! Great is the power of my maker, the weak cowers, and\
the strong revels in his battle lust! What is it you seek? You may ask me for a $boon as you\
have shown your dedication to Unamoin, god of Confrontation.
V:boon;Items of antimagic binding? Yes I have heard of such a thing. However such gifts\
will not come for free. Go forth and return to me when you have proven your $might in battle.
V:might;In order for you to gain access to the items you seek, venture below this temple.\
There in the shadowy crypts many have perished who sought divine favor. You will also try to\
conquer your fears and show me I can bestow gifts upon you. I want you to go forth and do not\
return until you have progressed in the arts of war, magic or other disciplines.
V:_return_false_;I see you mortal... I follow your deeds. You have progressed much in the arts\
of war and magic, but you are not ready for my gifts yet. Give yourself truly to my cause! Push\
yourself to the limits of your abilities... Then I will consider gifting your with the divine\
$boon you seek.
V:_return_true_;You impress me again mortal! You have truly applied yourself in your chosen\
disciplines and now you shall receive my holy gifts for your efforts. Behold the $tokens of the\
Keeper of Arguments!
V:tokens;Here take these objects of antimagic binding. With these, you will be able to break\
through the barrier we cannot touch. Hurry now, it is unwise to tarry with the gifts of a\
goddess.

P:Negative Energy of Hornaxx
V:_INTRO_;Welcome mortal. You represent those of my $favor in this temple.
V:_UNKNOWN_;Speak of that no more!
V:_UNKNOWN_;Harrguddh!

V:favored,favor;Yes, I remember when your organization helped clerics of my devotion. For that\
I am grateful. In return, let me tell you of my fear of a growning $shadow in the land. I foresee\
an $event in the near future that may bring a creeping darkness to all.
V:shadow,event,events;I feel an $imbalance is cast over your world, mortal. An $evil grows somewhere in the\
West. I cannot tell its exact location, but I feel its foul magic seeping through the veins\
of the world. Yet we gods stand helpless against this invasion... There is an $outside power\
guarding this seedling.
V:imbalance,evil,shell;The energies I feel are evil in their source. There is also an entanglement\
present here... an earthy feeling as if the very roots of the land waged war on the living.\
Very strong this $magic is... it blocks my most divine reaches and thoughts.
V:outside;These $evil energies are surrounded by a protective shell. This shell is not of your\
world, mortal. It is not known to me at this time where the barrier was spawned, nor how to\
reach past its walls. Be careful mortal in your approach for its $magic is beyond even my\
powers.
V:magic;As I have said, I can only reach the edges of the protective $shell surounding this magical\
phenomenon. However, even from this brief contact its powers overwhelm me... Black rock, earth\
and roots I feel. Tenacious like jagged nails, suffocating like heavy sand as it pushes my reach\
back. You will need $protection from it, mortal if you plan to enter it.
V:protection;Yes. You will need items of antimagic binding to survive entry into its fell domain.\
But ask me not for these, though I would, I cannot grant you what you seek. My task here is\
but to prophesize events of the future. To gain such a boon, you best $impress my twin energy\
across the hall.
V:impress;There are many ways you can do this. She is the positive energy, my twin opposite\
an ancient paradox. Nothing makes her feel more content than the presence of those of her\
disposition. Revel perhaps in her nature, the supreme deity of Confrontation: her maker.
V:_return_;You seek a divine favor mortal. It is not me you need however. I am but the\
describer of $events and tidings. The other side of my divine paradox is responsible for\
altering the fabric of reality.
V:truth;My twin speaks through your words mortal. She is both right and wrong in her assertions.\
Truth is not subjective, however a single truth does exist for every situation. I feel you\
will have to find such a conclusion in the near future. In the final hour of the world,\
it will be up to you to correctly ascertain the $revelations.
V:revelations;Perhaps ask my twin of that. She is shaping your futures even as our times\
pass.
