		keyphrase.0=_( "_INTRO_" )
		answer.0=_( "Stay your hand but for a $moment, intruders of my realm... I have $much to tell." )
		keyphrase.1=_( "_UNKNOWN_" )
		answer.1=_( "A blue bird sings in a shrill voice. Doom lies in its song..." )
		answer.1.1=_( "Embrace the children of the night. They hold the key to eternity." )
		answer.1.2=_( "Is not chance a dagger blunt on one side and gravely sharp on the other?" )
		keyphrase.2=_( "moment,much" )
		answer.2=_( "The pull of the depths are strong... Abyss-bound as I breathe my last, I must reveal to you the dark $secrets I was sworn to protect. I toiled long for $her... (cough) but listen, do you know this tune: fa-lala-laaa-le-grum-grum?" )
		keyphrase.3=_( "secrets" )
		answer.3=_( "I was an important figure, you see? Fa-la-la-le-grum-grum! What a lovely tune it is! 'Tis a pity this noble throat shall sing no more. Not since $her arrival anyway. What little time I had to practice my art, instead I toiled for $her. 'Go to the $Abyss Myco!' she would demand. That hag! I hate $her, I do! I will tell you all I know. Use my knowledge to stop $her plans!" )
		keyphrase.4=_( "Mothrazu,her" )
		answer.4=_( "Who? Fa-ra-rum-grum-grum-lalalee. (cough) ...Oh Mothrazu you mean. She is nothing to me anymore... But beware! (cough) a powerful sorcerer she is, yes! Her hate of civilization (cities in fact) knows no boundaries. She will destroy this world and rebuild it according to her image: a vast sprawl of dark $trees. It was she, who asked me to travel to the very depths of the $Abyss." )
		keyphrase.5=_( "Abyss" )
		answer.5=_( "A dark, evil place that is... home to the most vile, outer ones. Their names cannot be whispered, their breath is death and to gaze on them is madness! Fa-ra-rum! I don't know why $Mothrazu wanted me to $travel there. Maybe just to torture me for my failures? La-la-lee, La-la-loo! I've been there before you know... the fiend $Karzuul was my downfall once. Haha! But I escaped; seek the red $teleporters!" )
		keyphrase.6=_( "Karzuul" )
		answer.6=_( "Disease, he sickens the very thoughts! I served that dark lord before Mothrazu and now I will serve him again... (sighs) my fate is bound to the $Abyss. Fa-ra-ra-lee... I wish I knew the words to this song." )
		keyphrase.7=_( "Sabien,kidnap,travel" )
		answer.7=_( "Well I can't travel to the $Abyss on my own. Many of the red $teleporters are now locked... and always, always bring the $objects!| Anyway  I paid the $Order of the Grizzled Pony to kidnap Sabien. The wizard knows the way... A bumbling magician he might be, yet, his skill is gifted beyond the others'." )
		keyphrase.8=_( "objects" )
		answer.8=_( "Rum-rum-lala-lee!" )
		keyphrase.9=_( "Order,Grizzled,Pony" )
		answer.9=_( "The dwarves are the worst poets I've every met. Believe me, I would rather end my life here than to have to listen to their verse. However, they're much better at roguish tasks, such as $kidnap. They did manage to snatch Sabien, and yet he $somehow, escaped." )
		keyphrase.10=_( "somehow" )
		answer.10=_( "So it was you who helped $Sabien escape from the $Order of the Grizzled Pony! I should have known. The dwarves accepting a bribe was not a part of my plans. Fa-ra-lee-la-lum! It doesn't matter now... I just hope you're clever enough to stop $her as well." )
		keyphrase.11=_( "trees" )
		answer.11=_( "Yes that is $her plan: $Mothrazu intends to destroy the cities and cover the world in a forest. As a creature of nature, she claims it is her duty to do so. La-la-lee-rum-grum-grum! What a lovely tune. If you want to find $her, look in the deepest forests. She is the branch that holds the leaves, the trunk that supports the boughs... She is life and she is its destruction." )
