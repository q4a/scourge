		answer.1.1=_( "I can't help you with that." )
		keyphrase.2=_( "Uzudil,SCOURGE" )
		answer.2=_( "Yes, yes I know. Uzudil the Hand of S.c.o.u.r.g.e. Inc. sent me the $map. I know why you are here..." )
		keyphrase.3=_( "waiting" )
		answer.3=_( "I have the $map that $Uzudil sent me. When you're $ready, I can tell you all that I know regarding this matter." )
		keyphrase.4=_( "map" )
		answer.4=_( "This map fragment definitely depicts a section of the $Abyss. I am well familiar with its tortured landscape for shall I say... $personal reasons." )
		keyphrase.5=_( "personal,incident" )
		answer.5=_( "I'd rather not talk about that at this time... the memories are still too painful for me." )
		keyphrase.6=_( "Karzuul" )
		answer.6=_( "A fiend he is. Karzuul is the Lord of Madness and rules the 512th layer of the $Abyss. In battle he is a merciless hunter, as an enemy he ruins all you hold dear, the corruptor of hope and a stain on the divine soul of the cosmos. Do not treat him lightly! His connection to $Mycotharsius is surely not an accident... " )
		keyphrase.7=_( "research" )
		answer.7=_( "My research varied over the years... I was a student of Minirmuir once, attempting to attain perfect knowledge and thus transcend my mortal body to live in eternal peace, at one with the void. However... things changed... after the... $incident I took up a different path. I am currently seeking to restore to the world, that which was once known but is now lost... the safe operation of a very powerful artifact. One that though complex and dangerous is located very close nearby... in fact, it's right behind this locked $door." )
		keyphrase.8=_( "Guardians,Guardian,Guards,Guard,Realm" )
		answer.8=_( "Their legend is one of sorrow... thousands of years ago, after the defeat of an invasion of demons, a group of heroes banded together to form the order that came to be called the Guardians of the Realm. Though mostly a peace-keeping force, they also concerned themselves with the preservation of all knowledge of their age. This $library is one of a few they built around the world to house the rare books in which the Guardians recorded known history, astronomy and all other sciences and magic they learned. Their hope was to pass on their vast body of knowledge and let future generations know how to deal with another war should the $Abyss invade again. Sadly, before their work could be completed, in a final and cataclysmic battle, the demons destroyed them all... There is talk of betrayal: a treachery from within the ranks of the order is said to have caused their demise." )
		keyphrase.9=_( "ready" )
		answer.9=_( "Well, let's start with what you already know. $Mycotharsius had me abducted by those $dwarves but thanks to you, I am free again and able to resume my $research in the $library." )
		keyphrase.10=_( "dwarves,Grizzled,Pony" )
		answer.10=_( "The Order of the Grizzled Pony? Alas not much good can be said of them. They maintain their meager existence as both poetic and rogue hacks, selling their services to other low-lifes like $Mycotharsius." )
		keyphrase.11=_( "Mycotharsius" )
		answer.11=_( "I hear he met his end again... this has happened before you know. He died in combat once, but was resurrected by a demonic entity named $Karzuul. I think the demon took pleasure in bestowing the curse of unlife on the mage, to teach him a lesson in loyalty perhaps... At any rate, what is more interesting about Mycotharsius, is his $boss." )
		keyphrase.12=_( "boss,Mothrazu,Mothrazu's" )
		answer.12=_( "Now we're getting to the meat of our story! Mothrazu! Now there is something awful...  On the surface, she appears to be just another evil $druid, bent on the destruction of civilization. I'm sure you've heard the rumors: she wants to restore the world to what it was before the rise of the races. Her image of a world covered in forest is a bit of a cliche, you see? I don't buy it... there is something more here... especially, when you look at the evidence: a $map of the $Abyss? No, I don't think what we're dealing with is just a lowly $druid bent on revenge." )
		keyphrase.13=_( "druid" )
		answer.13=_( "To all outward appearances, she is a servant of the god of Nature. Even if she is evil, this is possible. Amod-Rheinur is a neutral deity who doesn't concern herself with the means to achieve her goals. However, I believe there is more to her story than what she'd let us believe: simple $revenge." )
		keyphrase.14=_( "revenge" )
		answer.14=_( "I believe $Mothrazu wants to travel to the $Abyss for some reason. You may have heard this in the ramblings of $Mycotharsius as well. (He let me know that much during my time of captivity.) What she wants from the dimension of evil is not known to me yet....  But, I think this is the reason why she had me captured. You see, this $library here is an ancient building. And like most things that are very old, it holds its own share of $secrets..." )
		keyphrase.15=_( "library,Gormoril" )
		answer.15=_( "This building was built ages ago by the $Guardians of the Realm. You may have heard of this order of peace-keepers... At any rate, they created these underground wardens to safely store all the information they uncovered during their time. The building had many masters before me and it is likely it will have many more after I pass. The only thing constant here are the priceless books and the $servants." )
		keyphrase.16=_( "servants" )
		answer.16=_( "They are a bit weird, aren't they? It took me a while to get used to them. But at least they get along with the $monsters." )
		keyphrase.17=_( "monsters" )
		answer.17=_( "Yeah about that... they only appeared a couple of years ago... Not sure where they came from either." )
		keyphrase.18=_( "secrets" )
		answer.18=_( "It took me years of study to unravel this mystery and I can't say I fully understand it still. However, I do believe it relates to $Mothrazu's $Abyssal travel plans... You see, several hundred years after the construction of this $library, when the $Guards of Realm were destroyed and the building stood empty, an order of evil monks took up residence here. They constructed a $planar gate, an unholy device that leads only to one place: to the world below... the $Abyss!" )
		keyphrase.19=_( "planar,gate,device" )
		answer.19=_( "You may have heard of this device referred to as a red teleporter. Once $activated it can be used as a bi-directional portal to the world of demons. I have been researching its history and use, and I think this knowledge is what $Mothrazu seeks, and that is why she had me kidnapped." )
		keyphrase.20=_( "activation,activated,activate" )
		answer.20=_( "As I said, my studies are not complete... From what I learned so far, it seems that even the order of monks who created the $device realized how dangerous it can be and went to extra lengths to protect against its accidental opening. This protection is in the form of a set of ancient wards that keep the $door behind me sealed. " )
		keyphrase.21=_( "SQ_LOCKED_DOOR,door,seal,sealed,lock,locked" )
		answer.21=_( "Long have I labored to open the seal and enter the room behind this door. Research in many tomes of magic led me believe that four $tokens are required to safely enter and activate the $planar gate. One of these you've already found: the Dragon-scale armor of the $Guards of the Realm. $Uzudil sent me this item along with the $map. The other $three are scattered in various locations. You must retrieve these items in order to ensure that $Mothrazu doesn't find them first." )
		keyphrase.22=_( "token,tokens,three" )
		answer.22=_( "I sent $Uzudil some notes on where I think these tokens are located. He can help you with the travel arrangements. However, waste no time! If $Mothrazu should get the tokens first and enter the $Abyss, who knows what evil she is planing to unleash! Of course, then $worse things still may occur..." )
		keyphrase.23=_( "worse" )
		answer.23=_( "You see, once the $planar gate is $activated, travel is possible in both directions... Not only can one enter the $Abyss, but our world will stand open to an invasion from there as well... Luckily most demons are relatively weak in this dimension. Without some sort of anchor or connection to their unholy lairs, they have no power in the material realm." )
		keyphrase.24=_( "Abyss,Abyssal" )
		answer.24=_( "It's the plane of sorrow. The home of the bringers of darkness. Though it has many names, they all mean the same thing: a boundless dimension without hope, mercy and grace." )
		keyphrase.25=_( "SQ_CHAPTER_8" )
		answer.25=_( "She was here! I don't know by what foul magic, but $Mothrazu passed through the $door without activiting it with tokens. I have tried to stop her, I... I... used all my arcane art, yet she proved too $powerful for me. Hurry and try to $stop her! I see you brought the tokens. With them the door will open!" )
		keyphrase.26=_( "powerful" )
		answer.26=_( "It took but a flick of her hand and I stood petrified as though rooted to the spot. Tendrils of a fibrous material clouded my brain and kept me motionless... I am sorry I cannot be more help. You must go $after her now... I am... afraid..." )
		keyphrase.27=_( "SQ_AFTER,stop,after" )
		answer.27=_( "Hurry! She is inside this warded gate! She must not travel through the $planar device! Yet she may already have done so... I still have not been able to find out what it is she seeks in the $Abyss. If you do not find her beyond this $gate the only thing left is to travel to the Abyss and hunt her down there." )
