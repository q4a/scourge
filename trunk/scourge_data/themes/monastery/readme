What is S.C.O.U.R.G.E.?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

S.C.O.U.R.G.E. is a cross platform, open source rogue-like game 
in the fine tradition of NetHack and Moria It sports a graphical 
front-end, similar to glHack or the Falcon's eye.
The design of the 3D UI is an attempt at the best of both worlds 
from old to new: It lets you rotate the view, zoom in/out, view special 
effects, etc with the feeling of the old-school isometric games like 
Exult or Woodward.

S.C.O.U.R.G.E. is Free Software and you can download it from the official website:
