ORCISH GRUNT
------------

Name:		Orcish Grunt
Author:		Andy "Boogieman" Craft
Email:		boogieman10@hotmail.com

Time spent:	about 2-3 weeks all together
Editor:		Quake2 Model Editor v0.83
Description:	This is the grunt from Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness.
		I have broken him down into many pieces so I can do
		tricks(watch his face when he stands) with the model.

Installation:

	Unzip all the files into a sundirectory called "orc" in your
	players directory.  You can then select the orc in the player
	setup menu in Quake 2.

Skins:

	I'm still not very good at making skins, but these skins are
	better than the ones with my last model.  If you make any
	skins for this model, please send them to the email address
	mentioned above.

Comments:

	If you have any comments, please send the to the email address
	mentioned above.

Have fun with the grunt!
