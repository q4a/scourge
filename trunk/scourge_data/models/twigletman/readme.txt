Model description       : Its just your regular human, I know its been done so many times
			  but I think that if you can get this done properly you can 
			  model and animate just about anything. 

Other info              : Hmm, whats wrong with it. Well loads of things, for starters
		  	  the neck looks like its broken in some animations. The forearms 
			  look a bit skinny from some angles and the top of the arms look
			  to muscley from some angles

Additional Credits to   : id Software, Asmodai for doing the amazing CTF skins and helping 
			  me with the proportions, Botlite for doing the amazing eXodus
 			  skin. And the people who made Qmdler and Nst.

Thanks to               : Didnt I just say?
