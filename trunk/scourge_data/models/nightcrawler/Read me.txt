Model description       : 
NightCrawler, also known under the name of Kurt Wagner, is a member of the X-men.  His Mutant power consists of the possibility to teleport himself over a 2 miles (3 km) distance.  His blue skin and weird hands gives
 him a spooky look, look that isn't reflecting his true personality.


Other info  :      	
NightCrawler is the third model that I made.  I built up the entire model with the software TrueSpace4.  Like I did for Darth Vader, I used the inverted polygons method to give a special look to the teleportation sequence.  I tried to imitate the HalfLife models by giving a mouth to my model, I like the result.  For doing the animations I used QME, while trying to keep the feet in place (like an IK skeleton would do).  For the skin, I created a muscle base skin with CorelDraw8, base that I colored with PhotoShop5.  Then, I used the software CorelPhotoPaint8 to convert my skin into the Quake2 color palette. For the Vwep I used the gun models of the Pak0.pak of my BaseQ2 directory, and then animated them with Qme.  I mapped the skin with NST.  I used Q2modeler to solve the "NULL skin found" problem.
