Model description       : Oh yes.  The Arachnatron.  He has returned form the depths of hell.  This time with a new style.  Let me stress this is NOT supposed to look exactly like the arachnatron form DOOM, but is supposed to be what I think he should have looked like.  I am especially fond of the soft body animation on the brain.  It was completely done by hand with bends, twists, and morph targets, over physiqued max bones.

I know there is no LOD's.  Since this is mostly a demo reel peice, I felt the time spent on it would be better used on the other models I have plans for.  And there is a small issue with the walk/run/backpedal: the max bones were extremely difficult to loop well.  I edited curves and even placed keyframes outside of the active range and it didnt seem to solve the problem.  As a result the walk/run/backpedal cycles seem a little bit abrupt at the point where it loops.  Also the jump isn't quite exagerated as much as it should be.  The bones started wigging out and twitching if i moved the legs below that point.  So it is what it is.

Anyways, ill quit my rambling now and let you play  :)
