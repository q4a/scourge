Before this project I didn't know anything about OpenGL.
Credit for my education goes to the following:

General opengl code:
Lots of people at http://nehe.gamedev.net/. 
These are probably the best opengl tutorials on the web.

3ds, md2 model loading and animation:
DigiBen (digiben@gametutorials.com) from http://www.gametutorials.com
Also very well written tutorials. I esp. appreciate the fact that both
sites included linux versions.

The dungeon generator alg. was described here:
