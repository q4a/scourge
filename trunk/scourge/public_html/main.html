<span class=invertBlock>What is it?</span><br>
<div class=block>
S.C.O.U.R.G.E. is a rouge-like game in the fine tradition of 
<a href="http://www.nethack.org">NetHack</a> and 
<a href="http://www-math.bgsu.edu/~grabine/moria.html">Moria</a>
It sports a graphical front-end, similar to 
<a href="http://glhack.sourceforge.net/">glHack</a> or 
<a href="http://www.hut.fi/~jtpelto2/nethack.html">the Falcon's eye</a>.
I tried to design the 3D UI as a best of both worlds from old to new: 
It lets you rotate the view, zoom in/out, view special effects, etc. 
On the other hand I've always liked the old-school isometric games like 
<a href="http://exult.sf.net">Exult</a> or 
<a href="http://woodward.sf.net">Woodward</a>.

<span class=invertBlock>Story</span>
<div class=block>
<b>S.C.O.U.R.G.E.: Vermin Extermination Services</b><br>
Life is comfortable in the quasi-medieval city of Horghh. In fact it is so comfortable that a
group of aging adventurers, having no monsters to slay, young people to rescue or tree-stranded
pets to fetch, decide to incorporate into a dungeon janitorial services company. After renting 
a run-down office-hovel on the shady side of town, the group accepts missions from a line of 
increasingly dangerous low-lifes. Our heros are hired by overlords, evil sorcerers and 
underworld bosses to exterminate pests occupying old dungeons, haunted towers, and other 
future centers of world domination. 
While working for the daily mutton, group members battle alcohol, decrese of self-
confidence and loss of integrity. It is an epic battle of mental and psychic proportions,
to which I'm sure most players can relate.
