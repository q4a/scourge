 # Make sure the required dependencies are installed:

gettext, scons, automake, g++ or gcc-c++, some devel packages for SDL (-image, -mixer, -net, -sound, -ttf), as well as the devel packages for libgl-mesa, libglu-mesa, libstdc++, libxmu and freetype.

 # To check out the code and data into a scourge directory (for building the development version):

svn co https://scourge.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/scourge/trunk scourge

 # For building a release version, you have to download and extract the source and data packages instead.

 # To configure it:

cd scourge/scourge
autoreconf -i
./translate.sh
./configure

 # To compile it normally:

scons

 # To compile it with debug support:

scons debug=true

 # Run:

./scourge

 # Run in windowed mode:

./scourge -f

 # To install it system-wide, run as root:

scons install
