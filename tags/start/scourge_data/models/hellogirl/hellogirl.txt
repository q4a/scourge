====================
About this model:
====================

This is my first attempt at making a model. It's not great! It looks like 
I scribbled it our with crayons!

It is supposed to be a superdeformed anime-style girl. 
 
The skins are lame, they took me like 1/2 hour to do all of em' so 
it's not too impressive. And psp3 made them all spotty.

The skin layout is wasteful and illogical. And i think i missed 
a few polys.

My modeling program does not allow me to create any new verts, which is
why I worked off a base model. I don't know why. It has a "create new vert"
button, but nothing happens when I try to use it. 

Also, I could not use bones. I WANTED to use bones, but again, there is a 
tantalizing "create bones" button, which was all greyed out. So I took
the model apart limb by limb, and individually rotated each part through the 198
frames. Which means I put in a lot less secondary movement of the limbs than 
I wanted, she's pretty stiff, and I did not "explore" the possibilities
of animation as fully as I could have. I wanted to do more with the butterfly
but i didn't. Oh well.

Also, when I welded it back together, I kinda 
slacked off. So now she's kinda choppy, and has wierd orange triangles
aroungd her joints. (let's just pretend she's wearing elbow and kneepads, ok?)

All in all,  please look on her kindly, as a first modelling attempt by 
someone who had no idea what they were doing, and with very low-end tools!

I would say this is a beta, except that I am really tired of it, and I 
doubt if i will ever change it further! So this is it!
