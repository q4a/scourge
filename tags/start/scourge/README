Before this project I didn't know anything about OpenGL.
Credit for my education goes to the following:

General opengl code:
Lots of people at http://nehe.gamedev.net/. 
These are probably the best opengl tutorials on the web.

3ds, md2 model loading and animation:
DigiBen (digiben@gametutorials.com) from http://www.gametutorials.com
Also very well written tutorials. I esp. appreciate the fact that both
sites included linux versions.

The dungeon generator alg. was described here:
http://www.aarg.net/~minam/dungeon_design.html
Narrated by Jamis Buck (jgb3@email.byu.edu)

Quake 2 models were borrowed from:
http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/

Quake2 Model authors:
Devil Hunter Yohko, by Evil Bastard (brian@zono.com)
Blade, by Mr. Rogers (ryan@sunstorm.net)
Shinju Murasaki, by sTuPiD fOoL (fool@rochester.rr.com)
Perelith Knight, by James Green (no email given)

The A* alg. was described on some message board that I can no longer find.

The Text class was adopted from code originally written by 
Mark Kilgard (mjk@nvidia.com) (c) 1997
