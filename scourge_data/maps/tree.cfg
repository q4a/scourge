		keyphrase.1="_UNKNOWN_"
		answer.1=_( "Long are the eons of growth... My roots stretch across galaxies the size of a hair's width." )
		answer.1.1=_( "Untold secrets unfold. My vista evolves with the sigh of the cosmos." )
		keyphrase.2=_( "human" )
		answer.2=_( "I see, you learned of its location from $Melathor of Allovium... Hmmm... Another name I have not pondered upon for a while. When you see him again, please tell him 'the bet is still on.'|| Now about the artifact: do you know $what it is you hold in your hands?" )
		keyphrase.3=_( "Melathor" )
		answer.3=_( "" )
		keyphrase.3=_( "what,Cronostar" )
		answer.3=_( "Yes, it is called the Cronostar. Created by the deep elves many centuries ago, but not as $Melathor suggests, an aide to gather delicacies for the dinner table.|| The Cronostar does have the ability to pause $time. More importantly however, it is a $key." )

		answer.6=_( "Yes, the $Cronostar is the key to re-awaken the Guardians.|| As you probably know, the Guardians of the Realm were the a scholar-knight order who dedicated themselves to the preservation of all worldly knowledge. They created a series of libraries throught the land wherein they enshirened a vast number of codecies that described all that transpired and were known to humankind. Even more, these sacred texts contained predictions for the future. Many half-described profecies since have come to pass. Many others still await their fulfillment.||The Guardians also defended this enlightened way of life from those that would oppose it. Historically this meant battling the fiendish inhabitants of the $Abyss. The confrontations with that realm intensified over the centuries, when at last the head of the Guardians foresaw the defeat and destruction of his order.||Few there are now who remember what happened next. To popular knowledge the knights passed from the material realm, following their last disasterous battle at the fords of the river Manar. And while it is true, that this final battle between the Guardians the hordes of demons was a singular event that changed history forever, the Guardians were not defeated. Knowing that the day would not be theirs, the knights instead willingly entered hibernation in the tombs of a nearby monastery of Minirmuir. Thus entombed they were resolved to wait and lie asleep for eons, until such time as they foresaw, when new heroes entered the land, capable to once again vanquish the forces of evil and throw off the tyranny of darkness.||What an immense gamble this was! For as you surely comprehend, were they wrong, and these heroes never arrived, or came too late, the material realm would surely have fallen to shadow forever.||I sense that time is now. The finding of the Cronostar signals to me that the world has reached a moment of crisis. A darkness ascends from below, and the fate of the realms is balanced on a cruel edge. ||In fact, have I told you of my $imprisonment in the $Abyss? I believe it to also be such a sign. Never, in my extraplanar travels has any being managed to ensnare me against my will." )

		keyphrase.8=_( "Arcanex" )
		answer.8=_( "As you probably guessed, I am a descendent of Arcanex, the original plane dweller, spawned from the waters of the thought of Amod-Rheinur. ||We are the tendrils that connect the $planes. It is seldom that mortals see, much less converse with one of my kind. I hope you understand that... It is by choice I decide to notice you, and the choice moves my mind with purpose to speak.|| Over the centuries I traveled far. I've seen the frozen ice planes of Varmal, the timeless wastes of Kal, even the despairing souls doomed to exist in the $Abyss." )

		keyphrase.10=_( "Abyss" )
		answer.10=_( "I suppose the place must feel dreadful to those in possession of a soul... ||For me, it was a waypoint, a stopover on my journey. As I stood stretching my roots for a while, a most awful thing happend: I was $imprisoned!" )
		keyphrase.11=_( "key" )
		answer.11=_( "Few know the true purpose of the $Cronostar. Only the innermost sanctums of the deep elven temples keep the sacred writings that describe how to $unlock the tombs of the $Guardians of the Realm using this artifact.|| It is a wonder the object survived... the agents of $Abyss were thorough in the destruction of all related evidence." )
		keyphrase.12=_( "imprisoned,imprisonment" )
		answer.12=_( "While stopping over in the $Abyss, I fell into a baleful vortex of a magical storm. Normally such events shake off but a few dying leaves, in this case however, the demon lord $Karzul took advantage of my situation and imprisoned me in a metallic seed he prepared for just such an occasion.||Why he would do such a thing, I don't know. In fact, little do I understand of the struggling ways of mortals or demons, though I have witnessed much strife throughout the years. ||Infuriated I was for the severe curbing of my freedoms to roam! What is a planetraveler who is subject to remain in one place? $Karzul promised me that the situation was temporary. In fact he said, very soon, a druid named $Mothrazu would release me... That she did and that is how you and I now stand here conversing." )
		keyphrase.13=_( "unlock" )
		answer.13=_( "Riding on the metaphysical waves of the lore of Xelphate, human history repeats itself endlessly. Some say, such thoughts are negative, or even evil. That the human condition is bound to find new ways to break out of its mortal boundaries and roam the multiverse in unexpected new ways.||If I may season this theory with a near-infinite lifetime of observing history and traveling the planes, I'd say, that is not so. Humanity does indeed tend to repeat its mistakes.||However, the multiverse, nay even the material realm is more than just humankind. There are places your kind has never heard of. The world still holds many wonders and sustains life-forms you could not even imagine. Few indeed are the beings who can comprehend the vast multitude of the cosmos. Unfortunately for you, the powers of the $Abyss can. However, so can the $Guardians of the Realm. After all, it was their business to preserve the order of the world, and all knowledge of it.||Therefore, though things may look bleak, I do believe, it is time to resurrect the knights of old; to call upon the $Guardians once again and with their help, move the material plane away from the brink of slavery and darkness.|| Use the Cronostar. Travel to the monastery of Minirmuir, unlock the tombs and call upon the defenders of life!||You see to me, it matters not who rules the multiverse, be it good or evil. My kind is far above such trivialities. We see the cosmos as an endless maze of pathways, logic and knowledge intertwined create a complex network of possibilities. The current fragment of this web, is what your kind calls 'reality.'||Having said that, I'm glad to help. I do feel that too much power, centered in the hands of one like $Karzul would steer this fragile web towards its destruction, eventually shutting down all alternates until all that remains is similar to endless wastes of the $Abyss itself." )
