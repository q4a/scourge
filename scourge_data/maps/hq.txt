# Npc conversations
# These are generic conversations that always occur
# Key:
#   G:key-phrase1,key-phrase2,...,key-phraseN;answer[,action]
# The key-phrase "_INTRO_" is the introduction phrase and _UNKNOWN_ is the
# the answer when the keyphrase was not understood.
# Words starting with a $ are key-phrases that link to
# other conversations. Lines ending with a \ are continued on
# the next line.

G:_UNKNOWN_;Uh, I don't know anything about that...
G:_UNKNOWN_;Perhaps someone else can tell you that. But I'll tell you\
about this $place and the $missions we work on if you want...
G:_UNKNOWN_;That's interesting but let me tell you about $times of old...
G:_UNKNOWN_;You sure have a funny way of talking...

G:_INTRO_;Those were them $times!
G:_INTRO_;Mmm-mmm, that was some fine $gruel!
G:_INTRO_;You look like an out-of-work $adventurer!

G:times;I reckon it must've been during the reign of $Haladil the grim\
when I was just a young lad. I would roam the country slay monsters,\
right wrongs and the like.
G:Haladil;He sure was $grim for a king! In fact, he never smiled until his dying day.
G:grim;They say he lost his ability to smile when our lives became so $easy.
G:easy;$Haladil had $nothing more to do, you see? There is virtually no crime,\
the streets are safe and there are no more wars to be fought.
G:nothing;Well, that's why we're all working for $S.C.O.U.R.G.E. Inc, right?
G:SCOURGE;It's not a bad $place to work... the $gruel is always warm,\
they pay in real gold and at least your $sword isn't rusting on a peg by\
the fire.
G:gruel;Go look in the kitchen if you want some. It's the best part of this $place!
G:place;Behold the mighty halls of the $S.C.O.U.R.G.E. headquarters. Here you\
can $train your skills, $trade items, rest and select your next $mission.
G:sword;Any items you find lying around are yours to take. You can even $trade them\
for coin.
G:trade;When trading, you can sell items, buy items or trade items of equivalent value.\
You will find that some merchants only sell a certain type of item. Also,\
your leadership skill will determine the prices you're offered.
G:train;You can assign the skill bonus points yourself when gaining a level.\
However, paying for assisted training is the only way to really achieve high\
levels in your chosen discipline!
G:mission;Go to the room with the purple flames. There you will find the $board\
which lists the available missions. $Uzudil handles our $clients mostly\
on account of them wishing to remain anonymous. 
G:board;It is a great wooden structure in the room with the purple flames. Every $mission\
we get here at the $S.C.O.U.R.G.E. headquarters is posted on it. You can also\
talk to $Uzudil for more information.
G:clients;Each client's $mission is posted on the $board. This way you can pick\
and choose which type of jobs you want to work on. I've never met any of our clients\
which is just as well... I hear they're powerful wizards who can turn you into an\
ant if they wish.
G:adventurer;Why that's nothing to be ashamed of! I myself used to thwart evil\
back in the old $times. But now that our lives are so $easy, I make my living\
exterminating critters for our $clients.
G:Uzudil;He is the large red fellow in the room with the $board. He handles our\
$clients, keeps the head-quarters stocked and organizes our missions. Talk to him\
if you want to know more about the work.
G:Melathor;Whatever you do... don't drink his potions!

P:Uzudil the Hand
V:_INTRO_;Welcome brave adventurers in the mighty halls of the $S.C.O.U.R.G.E.\
Dungeon Extermination Services Company! My $name is Uzudil the $Hand. Should\
you need an update on the current $news, just ask. Feel free to explore the\
head-quarters without worry: there are no $monsters here.
V:_UNKNOWN_;That is beyond my knowledge...
V:_UNKNOWN_;I can't help you with that.
V:SCOURGE;Think of these halls as your new home, for the time to come. The\
S.C.O.U.R.G.E. corporation was established to help out-of-luck adventurers stay\
out of trouble and keep their skills sharp at the same time. This is strictly\
a business proposition. The $owners ask no questions of you. Your past (however\
tainted it may be) is your secret to keep. The only thing that matters here is\
to keep our $clients happy. I am sure, you will find the $missions...\
"challenging".
V:name;Although Uzudil is my proper name, most folks call me "the $Hand" because\
my $job is to handle the company's daily affairs for the $owners. Check back with\
me between $missions for $news about our $clients.
V:Hand;Besides talking to $clients, I specialize in... uh... "handling the peace"\
here at head-quarters. As you can see we have many different types of people traveling\
through here so we have a strict set of $rules.
V:rules;The house rules are simple: HQ is neutral grounds. As such there is no\
tolerance for fighting here. Save your energy for the $monsters... you'll need it!
V:job;Mostly I am the mediator between our $clients and the $owners and you,\
the adventurers.
V:owners;I sense that you're not yet ready to learn about them.
V:clients;Trust me you would not want to meet them... Madmen, evil sorcerers, crazed\
clerics and (occasionally) aberrations seek our help. In order to establish their\
strongholds in this dimension, they cannot waste their magical energies cleaning\
their future homes themselves. So they pay us to do it and as a bonus they remain\
anonymous. Sure it's dirty work, but someone's gotta do it...
V:board;Yes, check the board frequently for new missions. It's located in the room\
with the purple flames. This is where I post new $missions as they arrive from our\
$clients.
V:missions;Our $clients requests come in the form of missions which I nail up on the\
$board in the room with purple flames. If you see missions printed in purple, remember\
that those are more important. The client is usually under time pressure and thus\
will pay more for the mission's timely completion!
V:news;Currently I have only vague rumors to tell you. However, check back again soon\
as I have a feeling that more important information will be arriving soon.\
I've heard from a reliable source that in the mountainous regions of the Hanath realm\
$nature itself rose against humanity! Horrible plant monsters leveled entire cities\
in endless waves of attacks. Still this is only a rumor, and I doubt it would effect\
us much this far away... If you are concerned, ask $Melathor about nature spelling\
doom for humanity.
V:Melathor;He is the "wise" elven wizard in the room to the south. Let me know if he causes\
any trouble... he is... "dependent" on his concoctions and sometimes he forgets the\
$rules.
V:nature;Not much to worry about I say... the only piece of nature we see here are\
the roots and rocks under the earth.
V:monsters;Many a fearsome vermin ye will encounter on your travels! Some use their\
strength and some their magic to try to annihilate you. It's best to be prepared with\
high level weapons, magic and lots of healing potions! Also, you can always\
return here to HQ to catch some rest.
V:Mycotharsius;An astute student of magic he was. Unfortunately he lacked the\
strength to stay far away from the powers of darkness.
V:Order,Grizzled,Pony;Nooo... don't talk about them! They torment me with their $awful poetry.\
It's a group of dwarven terrorist poets that has been causing trouble in the\
underworld.
V:Sabien;Although I've never met him in person, he appears to be of decent sorts. I\
usually only interact with (what I assume is) his familiar. A harmless humanoid creature\
short statured with shifty eyes. I believe Sabien wishes to remain anonymous... if that\
is his name at all...
V:Abyss;The plane of absolute evil... never been there myself, but I've heard it said that\
those who visit simply cannot leave! Must be a mad party!
V:awful;Yes it's quite bad even for dwarven poetry. Here is an example I received. It's a sort\
of a threatening letter they sent, in order to stop us from snooping after the $Order. It\
reads: "Stay out of the business of the Order,\
unless you want us to murder, those close to you and then, send poems of the same pen." Aaagh! I\
don't think I can take much more of this!
V:Guards,Realm;The Guards of the Realm was the peace-keeping force of the land a long time ago.\
Unfortunately, they no longer exist: they were all $killed in the final battle against the forces\
of darkness eons ago.
V:end,killed;The Realms of the $Guard fought and died valiantly at the fords of the great river\
Manar in a cataclysmic final battle against the forces of darkness. I don't know much about this\
great conflict, save that none of the $Guards survived.
V:Orhithales;The ancient sage Orhithales lives in $Thuzgol.
V:Thuzgol;The great dwarven city of Thuzgol is home to the Groez-Duil: the mountain dwarves.
V:Mothrazu;Sorry, I haven't a clue... Ask $Melathor, she sounds to be his kind... or better yet,\
ask $Sabien about her. After all, he was directly involved in her plans. I marked his location on\
map on the $board.
V:token;According to $Sabien, four such token items are what $Mothrazu seeks in order to activate\
a gate to the $Abyss. Be sure to find them before she does! Look on $board now and then to see if I marked\
a location where we suspect the item can be found.

P:Melathor of Allovium
V:_INTRO_;I am $Melathor. Would you like to $trade items, $train magics or hear $news\
of the world? ...Or would you care to sample my $potions?
V:_UNKNOWN_;Alas I know not of that to which you refer...
V:_UNKNOWN_;My time is too short to speak of that.
V:Melathor;I hail from the wooded lands of $Allovium, kingdom of the $deep elves.\
I am a practitioner of the arts of $magic. My specialty lies in infusing the spirit\
with the substance of archaic brews. Enlightenment is reached only through thoughtful\
suffering and my $potions can cause you to negate the very fabric of reality!
V:Allovium;The rolling hilly forested gardens of Allovium of the elves is indeed a site to behold.\
Perhaps in version two we will venture outside this wretched building so you can see it for\
yourself. As for now, how about some $potions?
V:deep;We are called the deep elves because our kingdom lies at the heart of the old forest of\
of $Allovium. Rare it is when the deep elves venture forth into the world... Rare it is when\
the mankind threatens to bring the world to the brink of the $apocalypse... but there,\
I probably said too $much. I believe it's nigh time for one of my $potions...
V:apocalypse;Did I say that? Surely things aren't so grim! Here, have one of my $potions.
V:much;Please excuse the ramblings of an old mage... Much transpires in this new world of\
humans that spells doom for an old forest-dweller like myself. Luckily my $potions keep me\
in good company!
V:magic;Yes, yes, I can teach you the basics... There is not much to it actually, just try\
to not blow up anyone in your party. Let me know if you want to $trade spells or if you\
need to $train in magics. Of course, it all goes smoother if you have a sip of my $potions...
V:potions;Ah yes, now you're talking! I don't understand why some people won't indulge\
more... they're lovely, you see? Different colors, shapes and smells in these vials.\
The happiest stuff on this side of $Allovium. Let me know if you want to $trade some!
V:trade;When trading, you can sell items, buy items or trade items of equivalent value.\
You will find that some merchants only sell a certain type of item. Also,\
your leadership skill will determine the prices you're offered.
V:train;You can assign the skill bonus points yourself when gaining a level.\
However, paying for assisted training is the only way to really achieve high\
levels in your chosen discipline!
V:news;You will get what you deserve! I've been saying this for years... Humans have got\
to learn their place in the world! You can't just build cities willy-nilly everywhere!\
Nature will retake its own. Surely, you have heard the latest news from Hanath? Creatures made\
from the very woods descended upon centers of civilization! The rocks behind which you hide\
will offer no resistance from the might of $Amod!
V:Amod;Amod-Rheinur is the protector god of Nature. Many spells of strange $magic are fueled\
by his divine power! Now where did I put my latest $potions?
V:nature;So you spoke to $Uzudil, did you? Did he say the $doom of mankind was nothing to worry\
about? Methinks it may not be the case! Beware of upsetting the balance of nature! Beware of\
awakening the wrath of $Amod! Fell $news as this is, it was high time mankind has learned to\
fear the awesome might of the god of nature...
V:doom;Yes doom! Our end as the ruling races of Earth is coming to a close. It's been a nice\
ride really. Aside from wars, meaningless religious differences, some basal characteristics of\
the lesser races (human, ehmm...) and the existence of the Yoddlers' Guild, it's been fun. But\
now, prepare for the end! Where are my $potions?!
V:Uzudil;The Hand, huh? I can't tell you much about him. Try to not make him your enemy is what\
I say... he looks like the sort who is entirely without a sense of humor. Mayheps if he tried\
one of $potions he'd have more friends.
V:Mycotharsius;Ah yes, I remember him well. He was a gifted magic user who turned to side\
with the $evil forces that eventually brought about his $downfall. You can only be so lucky\
that he is not alive today...
V:evil;I believe he made a pact with a lesser entity from the $Abyss to learn more of the dark arts.\
When he attempted to double-cross the $fiend it eventually cost him his life.
V:downfall;$Mycotharsius fell in an underground battle. He was preparing to cast a dark spell\
that backfired and took his life. Some say he uttered a terrible curse with his last dying\
breath to wreak vengeance upon the $fiend he suspected somehow caused his magic to misbehave.
V:fiend;I believe its name was Karzuul, a lesser demon of disease. If you seek him, he can be\
found in the $Abyss.
V:Abyss;It's the plane of evil. You would do well to stay away from it unless you're equipped\
to fight its demonic hordes in mind and body. If you're still not deterred to enter this\
dreadful place you will need to first find a $way in.
V:way;In the past evil clerics set up special red teleporters in their temples that had\
the power to travel between the planes. However, even if you survive the trip, you will\
need to come equipped with some very specific $objects... Surely now you don't intend\
to go through with this madness?! Here try one of my $potions instead.
V:objects;Uh... I can't recall exactly. Something about a Ping of Rotection? Or was it a\
special pair of socks that unleash fiery, blinding Fury of the Just upon the dominions of\
demons? You'll have to forgive me, it's been quite a while since my own adventures.
V:Order,Grizzled,Pony;The Order of the Grizzled Pony? The dwarves? Surely they're a harmless lot! I've never\
had any ill dealings with them. In fact I hear their poetry is quite lovely. Although I must\
confess, I've never had the pleasure of a recital.
V:Sabien;Hmm, sorry it doesn't ring a bell. A wizard you say? Strange I've come to know most\
everyone in the business... all of those still alive that is. In fact even those of... err...\
"extended" existence as well. But I've never heard of a wizard named Sabien.
V:Orhithales;The ancient sage Orhithales lives in $Thuzgol.
V:Thuzgol;The great dwarven city of Thuzgol is home to the Groez-Duil: the mountain dwarves.
V:Mothrazu;Well from what you tell me about her, she sounds like some kind of insane, cult-leader\
for the god of Nature? We have hacks like her by the dozens back in $Allovium...
