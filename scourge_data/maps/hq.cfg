		keyphrase.30=_( "link" )
		answer.30=_( "I think what $Karzul hinted at is such a thing. I am not sure how this is possible but it must that the device $Mothrazu is carrying will provide (when activated) a conduit to the powers of the Abyss.

In its center stands a massive tree, bursting out of the ground to the height of many stories.|| I've long studied of this being... this tree... spending many nights here in the library, unearthing dusty tomes from before the time of the $Guardians. I still don't know whether to believe all that I've come to understand... Such evil... such cunning!||You see, I have much to $explain so pull up a chair and listen." )
		keyphrase.55=_( "explain" )

		keyphrase.56=_( "fiendish" )
		answer.56=_( "The demon $Karzul has given the seed to our friend Mothrazu, the crazed guardian of Nature. She claimed that visions of $Amod - the god of Nature - tormented her dreams and drove her on the quest to cover the material realm in an antediluvian forest.||However, I believe it to be far more concievable that the source of these nightmares was $Karzul himself, as he tried to not-so-subtly nudge our druid closer to the chasms of madness. ||The only $question which remains is why he would bother with such a thing." )
		keyphrase.57=_( "question" )
		answer.57=_( "In order to answer this question, I turned my energies to researching the 'tree'. After all, why would a powerful abyssal being take such keen interest in arboreal studies? Rest assured, his motives do not include whishing to make the world greener.||In fact, when I finally stumbled upon the connection ( haha, good one) the blood froze in my veins... I rememeber even still... the wind howling outside my chambers when by the light of the last of my tallow candles nearly guttering, I found what I was $looking for." )
		keyphrase.58=_( "looking" )
		answer.58=_( "The ancient text nearly crumbled as I read its worn pages...||In archaic prose, it told the account of Licidus Arcun, the master scholar of Eruon - the ancient name of the very city of Horghh - who while collecting and categorizing species of nature, accidentally stumbled upon a being named $Arcanex.||Thought to be extinct for centuries, $Arcanex was the last of a race of sentient trees. One interesting quality of these beings is that their roots transcend physical limitations and can reach across multiple planes of existance." )
		keyphrase.59=_( "Arcanex" )
		answer.59=_( "Yes, it is pure genius, don't you see? $Karzul must have somehow got a hold of a seed of Arcanex - or another member of his tree race. ||Since $Karzul cannot exist in our reality without an extraplanar link to his home plane - the $Abyss - he sent $Mothrazu to prepare for his coming. I am sure of it! He plans to dominate this world, but he needed a mechanism to ensure all his powers would be available to him while in the material realm. A plane-tunneling conduit like the roots of the Tree of Emeril is perfect. ||Now $nothing can stop him as he invades and enslaves all of humankind." )
		keyphrase.60=_( "nothing" )
		answer.60=_( "I marvel at the genious of his plan even while quaking with terror... You must travel and $speak with the tree. ||Remember it is a sentient, though conversing with it is likely to be challenging even if it notices humans at all... Find out all that you can about its plans and details about how and when $Karzul is likely to enter our world. Based on the information you reconnoiter perhaps we can formulate a plan...|| For if with this last mission we don't find some way to stop $Karzul, we may as well say farewell to all that we hold dear.||Now go!" )
		keyphrase.61=_( "speak" )
		answer.61=_( "Oh yes, I almost forgot. I did read a bit on how to communicate with a spawn of $Arcanex. As you can I'm sure imagine a relationship between a mere mortal and a towering, arboreal plane-dweller is at the least a frustrating exercise in inter-species protocol. A more likely situation is that the plant will ignore you completely. In order for succesful contact, you must present the tree with a subject of interest.||It is just our luck that this particular spawn of $Arcanex decided to lair not far from the entrance of an abandoned underground deep-elven stronghold. Why the elves left the place is not known to me, however I do know that they left behind a powerful artifact, known as the 'Quen-go-Nul', or the $Cronostar. ||Simply put, the $Cronostar when activated can slow time in a given radius by creating a pocket dimension around its handler. I'm convinced, that the proximity of such an ancient device will spur any sentient plane traveler to endless chatter." )
		keyphrase.62=_( "Cronostar" )
		answer.62=_( "The Cronostar was created by elven mages in the ancient times - before humans, hrmph! Its initial use was to safely harvest deep growing mushrooms - an elven delicacy - from the safety of its pocket dimension. ||Judging from the fact that this elven stronghold now stands empty, perhaps the Chronostar's powers were outmatched by whatever force dwells there in the depths of the earth... ||Yet I am confident it will be no match for you. ||After retrieving it from the lowest level of the stronghold, proceed directly to the spawn of $Arcanex and attempt to make contact..." )
