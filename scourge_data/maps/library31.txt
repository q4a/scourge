G:_INTRO_;Have you come to $torment us?
G:_INTRO_;I deserve all I get: I am a $sinner.
G:_INTRO_;Oh how I $long for a mug of ale...

G:_UNKNOWN_;Uh, I don't know anything about that...
G:_UNKNOWN_;I don't know. We see very little of this $level...

G:torment,long;What you're not here to torture us $sinners? Nay, I think this is just another\
deceiption of the evil ones. Go ahead, rend my flesh, torment my mind, I have resigned myself\
to an eternity of suffering.
G:sinners,sinner;Yes, we are all sinners here. We toil forever on this $level of the $Abyss. It\
is a payback for our $crimes.
G:crimes,crime;We're mostly petty criminals... adulterers, pick-pockets, etc. This $level of\
the $Abyss is presided over by the fearsome demon lord $Karzul. As punishment for our crimes,\
his minions torment our minds and bodies eternally...
G:Abyss;Don't tell me you don't know where you are? The demons of $Karzul apply their craft well\
indeed. In case you can't remember, you're on this $level for having committed small $crimes in\
your former life. Were you a thief perhaps? Or cheat at cards? No one comes here without a reason...
G:level;The $Abyss has an infinite number of levels. This one is a holding area for $sinners like\
ourselves. It is ruled by the horrible demon lord $Karzul.
G:Karzul;Trust me you don't want to know... he's the enemy of life, the despoiler of good, the\
bringer of darkness. His words are bile and his breath: disease... If you still want to see him,\
proceed to the end of this $level.

P:Karzul Agmordexu
V:_INTRO_;Well, well... what have we here? Judging by your trembling, you $suspect who I am...
V:_INTRO_;Don't be frightened, I $whish you no harm... yet.
V:_UNKNOWN_;Please, allow me to turn you inside out.
V:_UNKNOWN_;Ah the screams of the tortured! A lovely music, don't you agree?
V:suspect;That's right, I am Karzul Agmordexu, Lord Protector of the 512th layer of the $Abyss. I\
must really apologize for these grim surroundings. But fear not, if all goes according to\
my $plan I will soon entertain guests in a much larger domain...
V:Abyss;Ah you mortals can be so entertaining! Look around you weakling! You will $soon call this\
place your home. The smell you will never get used to. Here you will learn an appreciation for\
eternal suffering. My minions will tear your sanity to shreds and break your body every day. And\
since you're already dead, you will be at our disposal to repeat these procedures endlessly...
V:plan,soon;I might as well let you in on my little secret. I plan to ascend into your world and\
bring about its utter destruction. Why would I do that, you ask? You mortals need to be taught a\
lesson in $humility. And who better to humiliate you than I the (future) lord of Hell? 
V:humility;You live your lives in the world above as if your actions were confined to the\
isolated realm you perceive as reality. As if deities were your servants you can bargain\
with for your benefit. Soon the powers of the material realm will $shift... Soon I will\
define your reality!
V:shift;I'm awefully sorry to inform you that you just missed my other guest, one\
named $Mothrazu. I hear this happens to you quite a lot... She was just here and is now\
on her way back with a special package... a... a $gift from me to... well all of you.
V:Mothrazu,druid;She is quite a charmer! And I must say, druids (especially the evil ones) are\
so gullible. All I did was arise her latent anger over the destruction of nature, and\
she now $serves me unerringly and quite against her better judgement. If she only knew\
that she's being used as a pawn in a much grimmer game...
V:serves,gift;As far as the $druid knows, she is carrying a device which will bring about a\
subtle climate change (if you will) of your world. I really can't get into details, it's top\
secret you know, so don't even ask.... Oh, all right, if you insist. I will add, that if\
activated, my gift (this device) will allow for the completion of my plans by granting me\
(and I shudder with delight) use of my infernal powers in your realm. Would you like a free\
demonstration ot them? No? Perhaps some other $time then.
V:time;Yes my guests the time will come when we meet $again. For now, I will let you live. I\
must say, I am somewhat impressed that you managed pay me this visit here\
in my home. I will follow your progress eagerly... perhaps I will make you my servants in my\
new era of terror. Undeath will suite you just marvelously (although it did not work well\
for $Mycotharsius... )
V:again;Ta-ta for now my friends... I will see you $soon enough! Don't forget to try to chase\
down the druid $Mothrazu, as it is entertaining for me to watch you squirm. I would not bother\
to reveal my plans to her; it will do no good. She serves me out of her own free will...
V:Mycotharsius;I hear he met his demise again... At your hands no less! Remind me to reward you\
for this when make you my servants. That double-crossing wizard was a nuisance from the beginning.\
Henchmen are of such low quality these days...
V:Quegazu;So you've met the merchant, that demon-turned-holyman? Despite what he says, he's on the\
brink... Just ask him about 'blood' or 'pain'. I let him fester in his tormented state as an\
example that goodness cannot save you and reformation is just pretense.

P:Quegazu the Reformed
V:_INTRO_;Welcome, welcome $good masters to my humble $shop...
V:_UNKNOWN_;Alas, poor Quegazu knows not of what wise master speaks.
V:shop;Yes master, let us $trade. I sell you good weapons and armor for cheap... Quegazu is\
honest and $good. You can trust all goods from Quegazu's $shop and his amulets will bring\
good master luck.
V:good;Yes, Quegazu is good. Not like other vile demons here and very much not like evil\
tyrant $Karzul (may he fester in boils.) Quegazu chose life of light and helpfulness. He\
can be trusted to $trade with good master. Quegazu $changed his evil ways and is a servant,\
ever a servant of holy deity Minirmuir (blessed be he).
V:change,changed;Quegazu see the light, Quegazu repent sins of past. Although sometimes\
Quegazu still misses taste of $blood and weak $flesh of mortals he tries to not think about it.\
He still longs now and then to hear the $screams of the damned he tries to not revel in\
their $agony... Yes, Quegazu tries reeealy hard to respect others and give tha.. tha... 
thanks for divine wisdom of Minirmuir.
V:blood,flesh;Tempt us not good master... ah to rend the flesh and suck marrow from the bones!\
To drive heated stakes through the... No! Quegazu must not think these vile thoughts.\
Quegazu will now say seven prayers to Minirmuir...
V:screams,agony;It is like music to my ears! The unending death gurgle of the tortured brings...\
But no! Quegazu is reformed. He is filled with light and toils only for $good.
V:Karzul;A master of darkness he is. Do not belive his promises! Stray not into his path for\
surely will you be crushed like the fleas you are to his unholy might. A blight he is, even\
here in the grimmest of all places. Quegazu knows $more... much more about this dark lord.
V:more;Karzul was once a lowly demon like myself. However, his heart was so full of hatred that\
even others of his kind shunned his presence. Then some time ago his ascendency to power began\
when he made a pact with an evil sorceror named Mycotharsius. Have you $heard of him? He\
eventually slew the wizard and raised him as an undead $worshipper.
V:heard;So you have met this Mycotharsius! A foolish mortal he was to $trust $Karzul.
V:worshipper,trust;Quegazu thinks Karzul's plan was at first a usual one: gather enough souls to\
infiltrate the material realm vy establishing a secret cult of worshippers led by the\
wizard Mycotharsius. Karzul being rather impatient saw this taking too long and chose a\
different $path to speed his destruction of the world of mortals along.
V:path;This is where Quegazu's knowledge becomes hazy. Quegazu is sorry to not be clearer and\
thus better serve the forces of $good. As far as Quegazu knows, Karzul's latest cohort is a\
creature named Mothrazu the druid. He is using her to continue where Mycotharsius failed in his\
infernal game to bring an end to the world of mortals.
