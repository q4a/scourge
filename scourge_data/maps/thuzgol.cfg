		answer.2=_( "I work on unraveling the $history of the town of $Thuzgol. I can tell you information about the $city itself, its $history or the $catacombs below. But enough about me... you look like you work for $Uzudil at S.C.O.U.R.G.E. Inc. Did he send you to gather information? Was there $something you were meant to ask me about?" )
		keyphrase.3=_( "something" )
		answer.3=_( "Quite so, something to ask $about..." )

		keyphrase.5=_( "Order,Grizzled,Pony" )
		answer.5=_( "So... you've heard about the Order of the Grizzled Pony. Finally $Thuzgol is putting its mark on the pages of history! Well, as much as the locals might idolize them, they're still just a bunch of no-good $thugs. I wouldn't go around saying this, but trust me I know. The Order is not all it's cracked up to be. " )
		keyphrase.6=_( "thugs" )
		answer.6=_( "My $sources tell me, that in the last manifestation of the insanity of the $Order, they hooked up with an undead wizard named $Mycotharsius. Who the wizard worked for, I couldn't tell. All I know is it's rumored, he kept a lair in the $catacombs below this very city. He apparently meant to call upon the wrath of $nature itself to destroy humanity. That was a score of years ago and by now I'm sure he's plan has been foiled. If I had known at the time that he was right here below our noses, I would've gone looking for him myself." )
		keyphrase.7=_( "Uzudil" )
		answer.7=_( "He and I go way back. Back before I knew how to mix my first potion or fry my first Rahuzmil with a Burning Stare, Uzudil and I hunted together near the northern city of $Grimvil. We are still good friends, helping each other out when we can." )
		keyphrase.8=_( "Grimvil" )
		answer.8=_( "A lovely place. Lakes, pine-trees, clean air and endless snowfields. I think after my $research here is done, I shall journey there again and dwell over one of the $fjords." )
		keyphrase.9=_( "fjords" )
		answer.9=_( "A funny word that is. Most peculiar!" )
		keyphrase.10=_( "sources" )
		answer.10=_( "Of course, I can't tell you that. One must always protect one's sources!" )
		keyphrase.11=_( "Thuzgol,city" )
		answer.11=_( "Thuzgol is located deep in the mountains in the middle of the continent. The city is home to the mountain dwarves, also known as the Groez-Duil. Among them most excel at the craft of the smith, the healer and the occasional artist. In fact you may have heard that the city is the original home of the $Order of the Grizzled Pony. Although the group moved on to terrorize other parts of the world, in Thuzgol they still enjoy a hero's reputation. Their contributions to the world of $poetry are not for the faint at heart! However, to be fair, the lure of their terrible verse does help the tourist industry. Let me know if you're interested in a brief $history of the city!" )
		keyphrase.12=_( "history" )
		answer.12=_( "Well let me see... the earliest records of $Thuzgol date back to the reign of Ironball the Raider-King. According to these documents, he single-handedly founded the city by forcibly taking dwarves from his neighboring hill-side clans. His rule is followed by years of darkness: the Goblin wars under Ruadil. I arrived in Thuzgol during this time and have committed her history to paper ever since. After vanquishing the Goblin hordes, relative peace ruled for hundreds of years. During this time it was decided that the people of $Thuzgol shall be called the $Groez-Duil." )
		keyphrase.13=_( "Groez-Duil" )
		answer.13=_( "Yes, you see, just being called 'dwarf' is insulting as well as nondescript. It's bad enough that most travelers confuse males and females (just ask the locals) but foreigners cannot be expected to keep track of the multiplicity that is the dwarven clan system. The complexity of such relationships is so hard to comprehend, that as a matter of simplification, a suitable pseudonym was $sought." )
		keyphrase.14=_( "sought" )
		answer.14=_( "At first, the collective might of clans was to be named Groerum. However, as many learned in the ways of linguistics quickly pointed out, this means 'udder-grease' in the flowery tongue of a hill-side clan. The Groerum was then renamed Groez and in an attempt to appease the warlike clan of Duil, their name was appended to the new title of the mountain dwarf collective. Now all dwarves living in $Thuzgol proudly name themselves members of the Groez-Duil. Fascinating, isn't it?" )
		keyphrase.15=_( "Mycotharsius,map,boots" )
		answer.15=_( "Mycotharsius showed cunning in his chosen craft early on in his career. He soon turned to the darker arts and became a powerful sorcerer of the school of the magic of Life and Death. But even this didn't satisfy his cravings for power, because later he entered a diabolical pact with a servant of evil named $Karzuul. True to his nature, the demon eventually turned on the wizard. Some say Mycotharsius fell in battle because his spell back-fired. You would do well to search the $catacombs for answers to your questions." )
		keyphrase.16=_( "Karzuul" )
		answer.16=_( "Not much is known of him. Most likely Karzuul was a demon of the Abyss, the plane of elemental evil. I would guess, he offered greater power to $Mycotharsius in exchange for the wizard performing a service for the demon. The details of this pact are lost to time and here-say." )
		keyphrase.17=_( "Melathor" )
		answer.17=_( "Works for $Uzudil you say? Never heard of him." )
		keyphrase.18=_( "nature,fire,witch,tokens" )
		answer.18=_( "You must be referring to that awful piece of poetry (naturally, attributed to the $Order) about the tokens? |'First find the four tokens|Lead the witch to the spire|Use sygils to bind her|And unleash nature's fire!'| I must say, I've been trying to figure this one out myself but to no avail. Perhaps searching the lair of $Mycotharsius will shine some light on this mystery?" )
		keyphrase.19=_( "catacombs,below" )
		answer.19=_( "Below the city of $Thuzgol lie the vast catacombs of an elder race. In all my years of $research about the $history of the city, never did I find any written records of those who inhabited this place before the $Groez-Duil. Today none dare to venture into its dank passages. Occasionally we here things stir below... dark things, not of this earth. Still, you should descend the slimy $stairs and have a look. I have a feeling the depths hold the answer to the riddle of what happened to $Mycotharsius." )
		keyphrase.20=_( "stairs" )
		answer.20=_( "Uh, yeah... about the stairs. All I can tell you is that they do exist. Unfortunately, I've misplaced my maps of the city and don't know where they stairs leading to the $catacombs are located. Good luck finding them!" )
		keyphrase.21=_( "dragonscale,armor" )
		answer.21=_( "Very interesting! How very, very fascinating. No, this is not the armor of $Mycotharsius, make no mistake. This dragonscale armor was not made in these parts for oh... 1200 years now. It was once the mark of the $Guardians of the Realm. The fact that you found one below the city of $Thuzgol means either that it's a portions of its $history I have not come upon so far, but more likely that the armor was brought here from $someplace else." )
		keyphrase.22=_( "Guardians,realm" )
		answer.22=_( "I only vaguely know of the Guardians of the Realm. I believe a long time ago they were a military organization assembled to protect peace in the land. It was rumored that the head of the Guardians was a supreme entity, perhaps even of divine nature..." )
		keyphrase.23=_( "someplace" )
		answer.23=_( "I don't know from where this armor came to rest in the $catacombs. You should ask this of $Uzudil when you see him next. I suspect if he doesn't know what to make of it, he'd know who does." )

No doubt you will make mistakes while visiting a local house of pleasure..." )

		keyphrase.28=_( "anger" )
		answer.28=_( "He doesn't like to be interrupted in his work. The reason why lives in $Thuzgol is because we leave him in piece so he can work on his research about the $history of the town. If you bother him, you may wish to never have set foot in his halls." )
		answer.5=_( "Ah yes, I'm quite the expert on the subject of the Order of the Grizzled Pony, you know! The Order is very secretive, yes! Their $lairs are guarded by Tyrant Hydralisk Deathlords except... uh... you see... they're lycanthropes, yes! Every full moon they turn into wolves. And $members of the Order themselves are dwarves among dwarves! They huge! At least 5 foot tall! Completely covered in fur and smell lovely like turned butter and sloshed ale. Ah, what a life it must be to travel with the Order..." )
		keyphrase.29=_( "lairs" )
