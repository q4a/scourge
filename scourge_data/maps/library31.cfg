		answer.2=_( "That's right, I am Karzul Agmordexu, Lord Protector of the 512th layer of the $Abyss. I must really apologize for these grim surroundings. But fear not, if all goes according to my $plan I will soon entertain guests in a much larger domain..." )
		keyphrase.3=_( "Abyss" )
		answer.3=_( "Ah you mortals can be so entertaining! Look around you weakling! You will $soon call this place your home. The smell you will never get used to. Here you will learn an appreciation for eternal suffering. My minions will tear your sanity to shreds and break your body every day. And since you're already dead, you will be at our disposal to repeat these procedures endlessly..." )
		keyphrase.4=_( "plan,plans,soon" )
		answer.4=_( "I might as well let you in on my little secret. I plan to ascend into your world and bring about its utter destruction. Why would I do that, you ask? You mortals need to be taught a lesson in $humility. And who better to humiliate you than I the (future) lord of Hell? " )
		keyphrase.5=_( "humility" )
		answer.5=_( "You live your lives in the world above as if your actions were confined to the isolated realm you perceive as reality. As if deities were your servants you can bargain with for your benefit. Soon the powers of the material realm will $shift... Soon I will define your reality!" )
		keyphrase.6=_( "shift" )
		answer.6=_( "I'm awefully sorry to inform you that you just missed my other guest, one named $Mothrazu. I hear this happens to you quite a lot... She was just here and is now on her way back with a special package... a... a $gift from me to... well all of you." )
		keyphrase.7=_( "Mothrazu,druid" )
		answer.7=_( "She is quite a charmer! And I must say, druids (especially the evil ones) are so gullible. All I did was arise her latent anger over the destruction of nature, and she now $serves me unerringly and quite against her better judgement. If she only knew that she's being used as a pawn in a much grimmer game..." )
		keyphrase.8=_( "SQ_SERVES,serves,gift" )
		answer.8=_( "As far as the $druid knows, she is carrying a device which will bring about a subtle climate change (if you will) of your world. I really can't get into details, it's top secret you know, so don't even ask.... Oh, all right, if you insist. I will add, that if activated, my gift (this device) will allow for the completion of my plans by granting me (and I shudder with delight) use of my infernal powers in your realm. Would you like a free demonstration ot them? No? Perhaps some other $time then." )
		keyphrase.9=_( "time" )
		answer.9=_( "Yes my guests the time will come when we will meet $again. For now, I will let you live. I must say, I am somewhat impressed that you managed pay me this visit here in my home. I will follow your progress eagerly... perhaps I will make you my servants in my new era of terror. Undeath will suite you just marvelously (although it did not work well for $Mycotharsius... )" )
		keyphrase.10=_( "again" )
		answer.10=_( "Ta-ta for now my friends... I will see you $soon enough! Don't forget to try to chase down the druid $Mothrazu, as it is entertaining for me to watch you squirm. I would not bother to reveal my plans to her; it will do no good. She serves me out of her own free will..." )
		keyphrase.11=_( "Mycotharsius" )
		answer.11=_( "I hear he met his demise again... At your hands no less! Remind me to reward you for this when I  make you my servants. That double-crossing wizard was a nuisance from the beginning. Henchmen are of such low quality these days..." )
		keyphrase.12=_( "Quegazu" )
		answer.12=_( "So you've met the merchant, that demon-turned-holyman? Despite what he says, he's on the brink... Just ask him about 'blood' or 'pain'. I let him fester in his tormented state as an example that goodness cannot save you and reformation is just pretense." )
		keyphrase.13=_( "deal" )
		answer.13=_( "You want to strike a deal with me and become servants of my era of pending darkness?! Hahaha! You amuse me... Yes, yes, there will be plenty of time for that once my $plans unfold. Once I am the tyrant ruler supreme of all that you hold dear... We will revisit this issue, trust me." )

		keyphrase.16=_( "evil" )
		answer.16=_( "Maybe weakling mortals have not noticed $where they are? Rejoice in the unholy might of our horde! Narzegg wishes lumpy outsiders consider the $benefits of switching to the winning side of evil. After all, Narzegg knows he's only $beautiful and $powerful because he toils only for himself." )
		keyphrase.17=_( "benefit,benefits" )
		answer.17=_( "Ah, so soft-covered mortals are interested in a deal perhaps? Maybe they want to be as $confident, $wise and $fearsome as leaders of the demonic horde? Narzegg thinks maybe they want to consult with Karzul. Maybe they should mention the word 'deal' to his infernal majesty." )
		keyphrase.18=_( "Karzul" )
		answer.18=_( "A great leader of demons he is! Narzegg looks up to Karzul as a mentor in ways of $evil. Karzul is a terrible demon lord who rules over this level of the Abyss. He excells in finding new ways to torment the sinners in our charge. None else can revel in their death gurgles with such passion! One day Narzegg will rule an Abyssal level. He shall name its capitol city Karzulia after the great leader." )
		keyphrase.19=_( "beautiful,powerful,confident,wise,fearsome" )
		answer.19=_( "Yes, Narzegg is a handsome demon... Many sinners say so as well. He is also powerful and wise. Narzegg will one day lead demon race in glorious conquest of other levels of the Abyss. Narzegg learned all his craft from might leader Karzul. In many ways Narzegg is similar to Lord Karzul... except Narzegg has better profile. See?" )

		answer.21=_( "Yes, Quegazu is good. Not like other vile demons here and very much not like evil tyrant $Karzul (may he fester in boils.) Quegazu chose life of light and helpfulness. He can be trusted to $trade with good master. Quegazu $changed his evil ways and is a servant, ever a servant of holy deity Minirmuir (blessed be he)." )
		keyphrase.22=_( "change,changed" )

He still longs now and then to hear the $screams of the damned he tries to not revel in their $agony... Yes, Quegazu tries reeealy hard to respect others and give tha.. tha... thanks for divine wisdom of Minirmuir." )

		answer.18=_( "A master of darkness he is. Do not belive his promises! Stray not into his path for surely will you be crushed like the fleas you are to his unholy might. A blight he is, even here in the grimmest of all places. Quegazu knows $more... much more about this dark lord." )
		keyphrase.25=_( "more" )
		answer.25=_( "Karzul was once a lowly demon like myself. However, his heart was so full of hatred that even others of his kind shunned his presence. Then some time ago his ascendency to power began when he made a pact with an evil sorceror named Mycotharsius. Have you $heard of him? He eventually slew the wizard and raised him as an undead $worshipper." )

		keyphrase.27=_( "worshipper,trust" )
		answer.27=_( "Quegazu thinks Karzul's plan was at first a usual one: gather enough souls to infiltrate the material realm by establishing a secret cult of worshippers led by the wizard Mycotharsius. Karzul being rather impatient saw this taking too long and chose a different $path. A faster way to move his evil plans along..." )
		keyphrase.28=_( "path" )
		answer.28=_( "This is where Quegazu's knowledge becomes hazy. Quegazu is sorry to not be clearer and thus better serve the forces of $good. As far as Quegazu knows, Karzul's latest cohort is a creature named Mothrazu the druid. He is using her to continue where Mycotharsius failed in his infernal game to bring an end to the world of mortals." )
