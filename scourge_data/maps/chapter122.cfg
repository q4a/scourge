    answer.3=_( "Yes. $Our charter in your world is to ensure nothing disturbs $their slumber. When the time has come for the awakening, new heroes would come searching for help.||Now the winding threads of knowledge speak of a new spring in the spaces of Arcanum. The time is here..." )

    answer.4=_( "You know who stirs even now beyond those doors...||Many years have they spent frozen in the voids of death. All the while, hope glimmered like a distant star above their black sea of sleep.||Their time is now, and $our return to the homelands is near." )

Magical beings called from the dimension of night to loan our talents to the safe-keeping of their sleep, until such time...||Well, until now, that is. Hurry, the Nightlord awaits!" )

    answer.0=_( "Ah, here you are finally. I will spare you the flowery metaphors of my minions and get directly to the point. (As an aside I always did love humanity's pragmatism... perhaps I'm the only such one of my kind.)||I assume you know in $whose crypts of hibernation you tread? I assume you understand $what is expected of you?||The unholy presence of the demon Karzul is clear to me, even though the dark Lord gave a wide berth to these sacred halls on his way up. I have finished the incantations and the tombs of the $Guardians are ready for the awakening.||All that remains is your $consent. Therefore, I must urge you to act quickly, and if you have any $questions, ask them now. Once the events of the awakening are underway, you will not find us here. With our charter finished the nightwards will return home." )
    answer.1=_( "I haven't time for idle chatter." )
    keyphrase.7="whose,Guardians,Guardian,Guards,Guard,Realm"
    answer.7=_( "The story goes something like this:||Hundreds of years ago, after the defeat of an invasion of demons, a group of heroes banded together to form the order that came to be called the Guardians of the Realm.||Though mostly a peace-keeping force, they also concerned themselves with the preservation of all knowledge of their age. Among other things, they build several libraries around the world to house the rare books in which the Guardians recorded known history, astronomy and all other sciences and magic they learned. Their hope was to pass on their vast body of knowledge and let future generations know how to deal with another war should the $Abyss invade again.||Sadly, before their work could be completed, in a final and cataclysmic battle, the demons destroyed them all...||However, the guardians have long prophesied their doom and took precautions against such events. With their destruction all but assured they retired to these halls and entered a death-like state of frozen $preservation." )
    keyphrase.8="Abyss"
    answer.8=_( "The Abyss? Why, it's humanities ancient foe... the home of all that is evil, the land of demons.||Rest assured the demon lord Karzul is not here on some kind of sight-seeing tour from his native planes. He will not stop until his powers of corruption brought humanity to its knees. Years of war, anarchy and famine will follow unless he is stopped." )
		keyphrase.9="preservation"
    answer.9=_( "Centuries passed, while $Guardians of the Realm slept in their tombs. It was a difficult choice to make, but in the face of overwhelming odds there was no better solution.||The demonic horde, thought to have destroyed their most feared foes, moved on and after many years of destruction turned on itself.||Battles erupted among the Abyssal troops, as ancient fears and jealousies flared. While campaigning on the material plane, the relatively weakly defended home base of the demon generals was assailed by other even more ancient chaotic beings that the demons displaced many eons ago to win their thrones in the Abyss. Finally keeping two fronts running became such a burden that their hosts were called home where the battle for dominance continues to this day. Such is the nature of evil...||Here life slowly returned to its normal, peaceful pace. The Guardians stayed interred since there was no reason for their resurrection in a now tame world.||But all that changed with rise of the demon lord Karzul.||It is not clear to me how he managed to bring so much of his infernal power forth into your land... Nevertheless, the time is now. The Guardians are ready to come to life again. All we need is a group of heroes to $call on them." )    
    keyphrase.10="what"
    answer.10=_( "Your world is in mortal danger. Karzul even now is preparing... scheming to bring civilization to an end. He will not rest until all of the world's leader serve him. And to this end he will do anything: start wars, incite religious riots, burn towns, fail crops, anything. Your only chance is to defeat him while he is gathering his might, here at the monastery.||I would think you have maybe an hour... maybe less. Soon he will use whatever conduit he has established to his native plane of the $Abyss to refuel on infernal energies and begin to spread darkness and pain.||However, powerful as you are, you cannot hope to defeat him. The $Guardians of the Realm foresaw this and built these crypts to while away their time, until heroes like yourself call on them in their hour of need. If summoned, they will return from their long night of death-like rest to fight on your side against Karzul.||In order for the $Guardians to reappear all I need is for you to $call on them." )
    keyphrase.11="call,questions"
    answer.11=_( "Here is how this works: as you may already know, pending their destruction the $Guardians of the Realm willingly entered hibernation.||In reality a deal with Death was struck. Death being eternal miser grants no escape only delays... Therefore it was decided that should the $Guardians ever need to return, given their past record of heroism (a fact that even wowed Death a bit) will be granted one leave of absence with the understanding that they will voluntarily return to Death's domain once their work was done.||However, in order for Death to agree to this rather unusual pact, he required that the reasons for calling the Guardians back be a genuine, honest-to-god end-of-world scenario. (As I'm sure you can see, for rather obvious reasons the end of the world would profit Death's business greatly but would not be grounds for a sustainable venture.) As such, he required that a new group of heroes consent to putting their own lives in escrow for the duration of the Guardian's stay. Were they to somehow break their promise, Death would claim you in their stead.||The $Guardians made me promise to impress upon you their resolve to remain true to their word. As they once willingly entered hibernation, so will they again stand under Death's banner when the time comes.||So what say you? $Consent now and call on the $Guardians of the Realm to aid your battle against humanity's greatest foe." )
    keyphrase.12="Consent,consent"
    answer.12=_( "Good... good... just as I expected. Your names have been recorded and your lives have been bound to the $Guardians'.||I will now release them from their long years of slumber, and then my Nightwards and I will return home. ||May Regbreon the Greatest Shade aid you in combat!...||When you are $ready I can teleport you back to the surface where even now the $Guardians await your final command." )
