M:D,Quest for the lost ${item1}
D:One of our returning clients, has managed to loose his ${item1},
D:somewhere in the bowels of his now abandoned lair. Your
D:job is to fetch this object and bring it back here.
D:Our client (a magic user of sorts) has promised a handsome
D:reward. He also noted that the item is more important
D:than it appears and is therefore under the protection of
D:an entity you may not wish to disappoint...
Y:Excellent job! Our client told me to pass on his warm thanks
Y:to you for recovering his lost ${item1}.
N:Remember, you still haven't found the ${item1}!

M:C,Seek out the ${item1}
D:A new client with an unhealthy look in his eyes
D:requested that we retrieve his lost ${item1}.
D:Apparently, the object is quite valuable. What makes his case
D:unusually interesting is that everyone who has gazed upon this $item1
D:has gone mad. If you should meet some of these unfortunate souls while
D:on your mission, do dispatch them quickly.
Y:Many thanks for completing this mission. One more unsavory client is off
Y:our backs for now, happy with his recovered ${item1}.
N:Please complete this mission quickly! Remember, you're looking for
N:the ${item1}.

M:C,Haunted monastery: kill ${creature1}
D:Should you accept this mission, you would be asked to
D:teleport into a haunted monastery nearby and neutralize some monsters.
D:In particular, our client wishes for you to terminate the ${creature1}
D:which has taken residence on its lowest level underground. Should you...
D:er, die, while on your mission, your belongings will be transferred to
D:the Corporation. (In fact your items will be inventoried while you are
D:away.) Best of luck, and no need to sign the timesheets this time.
Y:I can't believe you managed to complete this mission... er... I mean
Y:I never had any doubts at all! ${creature1} is a tough opponent.
N:Ah, so you're still alive and at it... Good! Remember you're out
N:to slay ${creature1}.

M:D,A vampire's quest: eliminate ${creature1}
D:A vampiric client delivered and urgent request to exterminate the 
D:pests in the underground structures of her forest castle. She is 
D:most interested in ascertaining that the ${creature1} is removed and is
D:paying in real gold for this job to be done. She has agreed to not
D:haunt the premises while this work is underway as long as you are done
D:by nightfall.
Y:Finished just in time! Good job! ${creature1} must have been hard to defeat.
N:The time draws near when our vampiric client must return to his domain.
N:Trust me you won't want to be around him, so get on with killing {$creature1}.

T:Chapter 1: Greasy pork chops with turned milk 
S:2,3
D:Early this morning a tall and obviously non-human creature stood waiting for
D:me at headquarters. It's gaze shifted nervously from side to side as it
D:recounted the tale of his master's lost wand. It seems, his master working
D:late one night conjured up a creature he could not control. While 
D:wrestling with the demon, he managed to entrap himself and the creature
D:in the dimension of Excruciating Nausea. Between fits of gurgling 
D:regurgitation he asks that we retrieve and bring him his Wand of Nausiation.
D:He believes its power can be reversed and used to extricate himself from
D:this situation. I believe we can make a powerful friend here if your mission
D:succeeds!
Y:Thanks to your heroic efforts $Sabien (the hapless wizard) is safely at home
Y:again! He vows to "do something grand" for us in the near future.
Y:Actually, this worries me far more than most missions we accept...
N:Remember to find the wand for $Sabien! He is an important client and
N:he's in deep trouble at the moment.
I:Wand of Nausiation

T:Chapter 2: Maw of the Grizzled Beast!
S:4,4
D:Perhaps you remember Sabien the wizard whom we rescued from the dimension
D:of Excruciating Nausea. It seems he is in trouble again, this time he has
D:been kidnapped by a marauding group that calls himself the Order of the
D:Grizzled Pony. While it is unclear why a group of aimless highwaymen would
D:trouble themselves with kidnapping the aged magic user, he asks that we
D:pay the Order off from his treasure chest and keep the rest of the money as
D:our payment. Unfortunately for us, the chest is in Sabien's other workshop
D:and is guarded by hordes of monsters. Good luck!
Y:The mysterious $Order (which it turns out is composed entirely of dwarven 
Y:poets) has accepted the payment and let $Sabien go. I have a feeling 
Y:this won't be our last dealing with the $Order!
N:Please hurry and rescue $Sabien! The $Order of the Grizzled Pony is a
N:a group of dwarven poets... they keep sending me threats... their letters
N:rhyme and the poetry is $awful!
I:Treasure Chest

T:Chapter 3: The Mysterious Benefactor
S:5,2
D:Sabien the wizard sent word that while he was being held by the Order of
D:the Grizzled Pony, he overheard a conversation. He asked us to enter
D:the Order's now abandoned lair and search for clues regarding who or what
D:their mysterious benefactor is. The tunnels used by these dwarven terrorist
D:poets should now be empty as their recitals were moved elsewhere.
D:Of course no cozy underground dwelling stays empty for
D:long... who knows what creatures moved in to replace the dwarves. At any
D:rate your job is turn up documents, maps or other clues that might shed
D:light on who the Order works for.
Y:Boots of $Mycotharsius and a map of the $Abyss?! This does not sound good... Ask $Melathor about 
Y:information on $Mycotharsius. As far as I know he's long been dead. Killed
Y:in a battle by his own greed for evil magic. He cannot possibly be behind
Y:the $Order... unless... unless the he's joined forces again with an Abyssal
Y:being. $Melathor should know more about this.
N:$Sabien is still waiting for any info you can dig up about the $Order.
N:He needs to know who the dwarves are working for.
I:Boots of Mycotharsius
I:Abyssal Map

T:Chapter 4: Among the Groez-Duil
S:6,3,thuzgol
D:You must travel to Thuzgol the city of the mountain dwarves, or the Groez-Duil as
D:they call themselves. Once there, look up my old mentor Orhithales and show
D:him the map you recovered from the lair of Order of the Grizzled Pony. If
D:time permits, ask around about Mycotharsius and the Order. However, this is 
D:a more delicate operation than you may think. Be careful in your dealings with
D:the Groez-Duil, as among them the Order is thought of as mystic heroes,
D:legends from the golden age of the dwarves. Orhithales you can trust. He understands
D:the true nature of the Order and he might be able to shed light on their connection
D:to Mycotharsius.
Y:Dragonscale armor?! I have not see one of these since the $end of the $Guards of the
Y:Realm. I'll have to think about what to make of this... Good work nevertheless! It's
Y:good to hear from $Orhithales again! We were quite close for a long time, perhaps he
Y:told you.
N:Remember to journey to $Thuzgol and talk to $Orhithales.
I:Dragonscale armor

T:Chapter 5: A brief visit with Mycotharsius
S:8,4,tower
D:Our agents have located Mycotharsius in the cellars of a peaceful monastery
D:called the "the Tower", near the city of Orn. You must journey here and confront him. Before ridding
D:the world of him for good, find out as much as you can about why he hired
D:the Order of the Grizzled Pony to kidnap our friend Sabien. I'm afraid however,
D:that his failures made Mycotharsius quite Mad. Therefore if all he can offer
D:is gibberish, try to look around his lair for clues.
Y:Good job, defeating $Mycotharsius! Now we know why $Sabien was kidnapped by the $Order!
Y:I sent Sabien the map of the $Abyss you found earlier and next you must visit him to
Y:ask how we can find $Mothrazu. I fear the end of all civilization may be bad for business...
Y:I marked Sabien's lair on the map posted on the mission board.
N:You still have to journey to the monastery of the Tower and defeat $Mycotharsius.
C:Mycotharsius the Mad

T:Chapter 6: Sabien's Revelations
S:10,3,library
D:You must call upon our old friend Sabien. He already knows the purpose of your visit,
D:because I sent him the map fragment of the Abyss you found earlier. Be sure to ask
D:him to explain its connection to Mothrazu. Additionally, try to get whatever information
D:you can about the Guards of the Realm. Remember that Sabien was abducted by agents
D:of Mothrazu before, so he is a key figure in solving this mystery whether he knows it or not.
Y:Interesting... so $Sabien claims $Mothrazu is trying to enter the $Abyss? I have
Y:read the notes he sent me and marked the location of the next $token on the $board.
N:Have you traveled to see $Sabien yet? I marked his library on the $board.
S:Talk to Sabien

T:Chapter 7: Tokens of the Gods
S:12,5
D:Browsing through Sabien's notes about the four tokens, it seems they are to be found quite
D:close to here in an underground complex. The building is similar to the library of Sabien,
D:because in fact, it was also built by the Guardians of the Realm. I expect since it stood 
D:empty for many centuries, several powerful monsters set up lair in its abandoned halls. But
D:surely such trivialities do not concern heroes of your magnitude. And do hurry; I believe
D:we're past earning a living and got ourselves into a saving the world type situation in
D:earnest...
Y:You must now take these $tokens to $Sabien in his library. Hurry, for only he knows how to
Y:employ them to unlock the wards that protect the door to the planar $device.
N:By the gods! While you amble about, the fate of the world hangs by a thread! Hurry and find
N:the $tokens $Sabien needs!
I:The myriagonal token of Unamoin
I:The nonagonal token of Soroughoz
I:The hendecagonal token of Garzul-Meg-Aonrod
