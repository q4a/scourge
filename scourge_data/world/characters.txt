C:Ranger,10,2,6,400,RA,1,6
D:You are a ranger, a specialized fighter. You know the outdoors, you can read weather patterns, predict avalanches
D:and easily find food and water in the outdoors. What a pity that you must serve with your fellow dungeon-vermin 
D:exterminators within the narrow confines of this subterranian realm. Still some of your ranger skills come in
D:handy. You're can read monsters' tracks, find traps and able to cast some spells from the house of Nature. The
D:defining attribute skills of a ranger are Lore, Speed and Power.

C:Knight,12,0,7,350,KN,1,6
D:Ah, the knight... need we mention what irony it is to see thee in such circumstances? Sure, there were the
D:few and misguided who used their prowress and position for, uh, "deeds of darkness". However, by and large,
D:a knight stands as the paragon of virtue, the upholder of justice, the keeper of the rights of the innocent. As 
D:such, it makes us very much interested, yes, morbidly fascinated, to know what one could possibly be doing in
D:dank, shadow-filled, vile places under the earth? Hmmm? The defining attributes of a knight are Power, 
D:Coordination and Leadership.

C:Tinkerer,7,4,6,300,TI,0.7,8
D:A tinkerer represents the very edge in applied sciences of the day. This usually manifests itself in a lack
D:of a complete set of digits, facial hair and teeth. The craving to make use of the latest technologies

D:skills of a tinkerer are Coordination, IQ and Luck.

C:Assassin,6,4,5,400,AS,0.9,8

C:Conjurer,4,7,3,500,CO,0.5,12
D:Of the professions dealing purely with magic, the Conjurer is your standard wizard-type. Think long white 
D:beard (in the case of men and some women) and pointy hat. Conjurors keep immense amounts of information

D:nothing could be farther from the truth! When casting spells, most magicians try to remain inconspicuous from 
D:the deities. The most useful traits of conjuror are IQ and Luck.

D:hidden until such time that the pact comes to an end.

D:Some herbs you found made you ill, while others healed your wounds. Being a naturalist is
D:dangerous business but if you have a good memory, the payoff is worth it. Some naturalists

D:cast simple (usually from the school of Nature) spells.

C:Monk,6,6,6,400,MO,0.8,8
D:Your fanatical devotion to your deity overshadows your need to acquire material goods. Most

D:use of melee weaponry, specializing instead in unarmed combat and the divine focus of the bow.
