		text1=_("Welcome to the world of S.c.o.u.r.g.e.")
	
		text2=_("||S.c.o.u.r.g.e. \
is a rogue-like rpg that lets you control a group of four brave heroes.\
While working for a dungeon janitorial services company they become unwilling \
participants in an effort to stop a mysterious force from wiping out humanity. \
Boring you say? But wait, there is more! Your stay at the S.c.o.u.r.g.e. head-\
quarters is generously detailed in 3d! You will travel to strange and exotic \
underground locations! The randomly generated maps ensure the game's infinite \
replayability. There is music, effects, a, a... a plot! You will encounter, \
speak, trade with, and occasionally dispatch a large number of npc-s and monsters. \
Blood-curdling combat will unfold in either frantic real-time or thoughtful \
turn-based presentation.||")

		text3=_("So stay a while... hunker down for adventure in the \
true underworld. The noxious fumes and psychedelic molds from the very walls \
of the crypts below the city of Horghh await.||")
