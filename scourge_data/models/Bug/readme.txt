SOFTWARE USED (stop emailing me about this ;)
-------------
qme.exe lite for quake	http://www.3dmatrix.com/index.htm
mdl.exe	Quake 2 Modeller 0.83	by Phillip Martin	martinp1@topaz.cqu.edu.au

installation 
------------
FIRST delete any previous version of the bug model (or back it up as you prefer)
Just make sure there is no directory called bug in the quake\baseq2\players directory

THEN just like all the other model modifications if it doesn't make sense look the
others up just unzip the contents of this zip into the \quake\baseq2\players\ directory
this should create a directory called bug with the usual files in it
e.g.

 c:\quake2\baseq2\players\bug\tris.md2	etc


also make sure there are no files in the players directory just the subdirectorys
this should ensure all the ppm's work

Tatey's comments
----------------
last i looked somebody 'DormRat' has already done a mesh update and some skins of his
own hosted at the body shop buggy.zip errm hence the pointlessness of this update, but
still in my opinion ive cut n pasted some decent skins your at your own compleat libity
to choose your own version of this model to download, i'd say the end product is very
similar, however if your interested in skinning the bug DormRats mesh is proberly better
for people using 2D editors such as photoshop etc umm id include the tris.md2 file with
any skins that you may want to have hosted so that any future downloaders get the right
dm2 file to go with the right skin

right of course your free to modify the model yourself or use in any which way you want
,such as a TC, so long as i get some credit 

umm any budding model builders make sure you get it right first time cos all this pissing
about with updates is crap
